UC Irvine Offers UC-Wide Environmental Injustice Anthropology Class this Summer,"UC Irvine (UCI) recently announced it will open up its anthropology course titled Environmental Injustice to all UC students during the upcoming summer and fall 2021 quarters. This course will be available as ANTH25A, and will focus on researching case studies of environmental injustice in communities across California. The Bottom Line (TBL) sat down with UC Irvine Teaching Assistant (TA), Tim Schütz, to learn more about this upcoming course.

The course was created by Kim Fortun, a UCI professor with research experience in how environmental disasters affect public health. Fortun is part of the Platform for Experimental, Collaborative Ethnography (PECE), an open-source software that brings together scientists of all disciplines for collaboration and data sharing in efforts to create an international environmental science database. Schütz, who has been Fortun's TA for the past three years, also emphasizes her impressive career in mapping environmental statistics, such as her work on the 1980 Bhopal Gas leak in India. 

Fortun began ANTH25A in her pursuit to expand collaborative research with disaster experts. Regarding how this course will continue to be offered UC-wide when it transitions into hybrid classes this fall, Schütz reveals how this class was already taught  in an online-based style before the COVID-19 pandemic. Schütz reflects on how this earlier experience allowed instructors to move smoothly into remote teaching during this time. He adds that the course’s history will allow UC students to take it even when campuses return to in-person instruction as it will still be hybrid-based.

In this interdisciplinary class, students learn how to look at environmental injustice from a largely anthropological perspective and contribute their own research on environmental justice. Environmental justice expert Schütz explains the course examines how environmental harm disproportionately affects minorities. He describes this injustice as having different forms, from how factories pollute the air and water systems to how industrial sites are built in marginalized neighborhoods.

“[It’s] one thing to call for environmental justice and then [another] identifying different kinds of injustice, and that’s what the course is kind of uniquely designed for,” Schütz explained.

This course explores the three different kinds of disasters: fast (industrial disasters), slow (water and air contamination) and combinations of both (like climate change). For example, the class begins by studying the intersection between racism and environmental injustices with a virtual tour of Cancer Valley, a case study done in Louisiana where locations of historic sugar plantations are now being used as sites for chemical plants. Students learn how emissions from these plants are often linked to greater numbers of cancer cases in the surrounding communities, many of which include Black Americans and other minority groups. 

Students also cover a variety of concepts when investigating these disasters in this class from companies using “greenwashing” and misleading consumers about their environmental footprint, to local cases of environmental injustice across California. Students learn to perform stakeholder analysis, read and utilize data, and research public health impacts.

By the end of the course, students publish their own case studies using PECE’s Disaster STS Network, a platform that focuses on sharing, archiving, analyzing, and publishing accessible data. Ultimately, Schütz states, the goal of the course is to have students ask anthropological questions about how people define an environmental problem and how they can make sense of local situations. 

While it is the third year this course has been running, it is the first time that ANTH25A has been offered to students across the UC system. Schütz points out that the reason for this change is to create an even greater opportunity to widen the analytic lens of the class, connect people across California campuses, and further push the environmental justice movement.

“Since it’s a lower-division class it’s become hugely popular for people who want that kind of extra training [...] I think people need a desire, kind of assistance, to make sense of what’s good and what’s bad and where to go, and what kind of position to take on these issues,” Schütz adds.


Finally, Schütz encourages students to enroll in ANTH25A even if they are unfamiliar with group work as the class will help build their research and teamwork skills. He announces that PECE and its Disaster STS Network will be having an environmental governance internship program this summer, where students and community members can broaden their understanding of environmental justice and science.

UC Santa Barbara Opens Clinic to Distribute Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine,"As COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available, UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) partnered with the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (SBCPHD) to increase accessibility of vaccines for those living in Isla Vista (I.V.) and working on campus.

On May 17, UCSB announced that a Johnson & Johnson's Janssen (J&J/Janssen) COVID-19 vaccination clinic will be held at the Student Health (SHS) building. The weekly clinic will be open to all faculty, staff, and students age 18 and older from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on May 20, May 27, and June 3 — it will conclude on June 10.

ON MAY 17, UCSB ANNOUNCED THAT A JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S JANSSEN (J&J/JANSSEN) COVID-19 VACCINATION CLINIC WILL BE HELD AT THE STUDENT HEALTH (SHS) BUILDING.

Vaccinations are free of charge and insurance is not required. Students can schedule an appointment through the SHS Patient Portal and must provide a government-issued photo ID at check-in. 

STUDENTS CAN SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT THROUGH THE SHS PATIENT PORTAL AND MUST PROVIDE A GOVERNMENT-ISSUED PHOTO ID AT CHECK-IN. 

The Bottom Line spoke to Dr. Vejas Skripkus, Executive Director of Student Health, about the vaccination clinic and UCSB’s partnership with the SBCPHD. “Every vaccine that we administer is one step closer to fully opening our campus,” said Skripkus. According to KCSB-FM radio, out of all of the students registered for spring quarter, approximately 64 percent have received at least one dose of the vaccine as of May 24.  

“As more people get vaccinated and the case rates for COVID-19 decrease, the county will be able to move down in tier levels, and that will allow the campus to begin hosting outdoor celebrations,” continued Dr. Skripkus.

In accordance with the California Department of Public Health’s COVID-19 Guidelines for Outdoor Events, all attendees should be screened for COVID-19 symptoms before leaving home for an event. For the entire duration of the event, attendees must wear masks and maintain a safe distance of at least six feet from other attendees. If Santa Barbara County qualifies for the Yellow Tier this upcoming week, capacity for outdoor gatherings would double from 100 to 200 attendees — 400 if all guests are tested or show proof of vaccination ahead of time.

Dr. Skripkus graciously thanked the partnership between UCSB and the SBCPHD for providing this vaccination clinic for students and faculty. “It has been great to work with the SBCPHD. They sent their mobile vaccine clinic to our facility on May 6 and will return on June 3 for the second Moderna vaccine dose. I am hopeful that we will continue to be able to partner with the SBCPHD through the summer and into the fall,” Skripkus said.

Thanks to the SBCPHD, other vaccination clinics are popping up at farmers' markets, open-air markets, and grocery store parking lots. In an interview with KCSB-FM, SBCPHD officer Dr. Henning Ansorg said, “This is the light at the end of the tunnel that we have all been waiting for.”

UCSB will continue to partner with the SBCPHD to receive vaccines and will plan more vaccine clinics in the future. Dr. Skripkus says social distancing and mask guidelines will also change as more individuals get vaccinated. The J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine is a one-dose vaccine that has emergency use authorization by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA have recommended use of the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine in the United States after a temporary pause.

AS Passes Bill to Reform the Honorarium of Senators and BCUs,"The UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) Associated Students (AS) Senate recently passed a bill raising the honorarium of appointed and elected officers which was co-authored by Senator Esmeralda Quintero-Cubillan and Senator Emanuel Roman.

""AN HONORARIUM IS THE SALARY SENATORS

 AND OFFICERS RECEIVE AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER...""

An honorarium is the salary senators and officers receive at the end of each quarter in return for their service to the student body and the university. Currently, UCSB’s student government is one of the most funded across the UC System, with $211.59 per quarter – or $634.77 per year – in student fees included in undergraduate tuition going toward AS operations. 

Honoraria values are capped, meaning that the bill will not automatically entitle senators and officials to the increased amounts when it goes into effect during the 2021-22 school year. Additionally, each recipient’s quarterly performance would be evaluated to ensure payments, and recommendations are justified by their labor.

“Such highest-ranking official(s) of each Board, Commissions, Unit (BCU); Senate and Senate’s standing committee’s; and offices within the Executive Branch and Judicial Council shall submit a report on behalf of the entity detailing the individual work completed by each entity's members by week seven,” reads the bill. 

A total of 75 percent of the requirements assessed for receiving honoraria include attending Senate meetings and engaging at committee meetings, holding office hours, and participating in Senate group projects. The remaining 25 percent of the performance review is based on authoring legislation, being an active member of the Senate, and performing any other duties outlined in the AS Constitution or bylaws. All officials must also take a minimum of six units per quarter and maintain at least a 2.0 GPA. 

The Honoraria Committee reviews each request for the quarter. After discussions with committee chairs and approval from the Legislative Council, the members conclude if the officer or senator has sufficiently completed their responsibilities. If the committee determines that the officer’s effort doesn’t justify the proposed salary, it will recommend a reduction or removal. 

According to section four of the new bill, general-appointed officials will be eligible for up to $300. Appointed chairs and vice chairs of any BCU office within the executive branch and judicial council will be capped at $450 per quarter, while senators will not receive an amount greater than $600 per quarter. 

The previous capped amounts, which are outlined in the 2020-21 AS Legal Code, were previously $200 for general-appointed officials, $350 for BCU’s within the Executive Branch and Judicial Council, and $400 for senators. This amounts to an approximate 50 percent increase for senators and general-appointed officials, while the honorarium for BCU officials is increased by approximately 28 percent. 

""SENATOR QUINTERO-CUBILLAN AND SENATOR ROMAN INTEND FOR THE $100 INCREASE FROM LEFTOVER FUNDING TO MAKE AS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS...""

Senator Quintero-Cubillan and Senator Roman intend for the $100 increase from leftover funding to make AS more accessible to underrepresented students from marginalized backgrounds at UCSB, where insufficient compensation can be a barrier to participating in extracurricular activities. According to the bill, past attempts to lower the cap for honoraria have prevented many students from pursuing and exploring opportunities offered by AS. 

“I feel like increasing how much the student officials make would be a good thing because they are putting in time and effort on top of school and potentially other things like a job or internship,” said Hannah Morris, a fourth-year communication major.

“It’s a good thing to compensate people for their work, especially students who are doing the most,” she continued. 

Students interested in getting involved with AS at UCSB can apply for open leadership or membership roles in its committees and can also look for information about running for a senate position for the 2022-23 school year during the winter quarter.

Cops Off Campus: A March to Recognize the Movement,"On May 17, UC Santa Barbara’s (UCSB) Cops Off Campus held an art build, march, and vigil to demand police abolition at UCSB and throughout the community. Cops Off Campus is a coalition that developed throughout the pandemic after the rise of violence against Black, Brown, and Indigenous people. Membership is composed of university students, faculty, community organizations, and other workers with a goal to see police removed from college campuses by the fall of 2021. 

On May 17, UC Santa Barbara’s (UCSB) Cops Off Campus held an art build, march, and vigil to demand police abolition at UCSB and throughout the community.

The event took place in Isla Vista (I.V) and was part of the larger Cops Off Campus coalition’s month of actions campaign, which will be taking place throughout the month of May. Many local I.V. residents joined the march to help commemorate the lives lost to police officers and to stand against police forces on campus.

Many local I.V. residents joined the march to help commemorate the lives lost to police officers and to stand against police forces on campus.

Cops Off Campus aims to rebuild the world into a place where community safety, healthcare, and guaranteed jobs can eliminate prisons, police, military bases, and detention centers. The group is associated with other organizations on campus, including Coffee Not Cops, a student-run group that advocates for police abolition, and UCSB COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment), which fights against the unfair cost of living adjustments on UC campuses.

Monday’s Cops Off Campus march was held to specifically recognize proposed revisions to the UC Police Department (UCPD) policies that would allow for further militarization and escalation of policing. According to event participant, Emma Rose Mahoney, this action will only allow police to expand the area of noncompliance.

“If you move in any way when someone is trying to constrain you or beat you up, that’s noncompliance. If you take a stance of passivity, like if you sit on the ground or take a knee, that’s seen as noncompliance. If you plead, it’s seen as noncompliance … if you say ‘I can’t’ breathe,’ they have the right to use violence against you,” Mahoney said.

In addition to participating in the march, Mahoney has attended Coffee Not Cops meetings, which take place every Friday from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. in front of I.V. Theater, and has been a long-time anti-cop visionary. Mahoney said that putting on a public march made the often unseen negative impact of police more noticeable to the I.V. community. 

“I feel like in Santa Barbara especially we live in a little bubble where we think everything is perfect and that the police aren’t murdering anyone, but that’s not true,” Mahoney said. “At the vigil after the march, they said the names of people who have been murdered in Santa Barbara and counties nearby, and the names of police people that were murdering those people. And I had no idea. It had never been mentioned.”

Mahoney said that marching through I.V. gave people who hadn’t originally heard about the event a chance to join in. Publicly displaying the movement in the heart of I.V. allows anyone to get involved in activism which is not a privilege to do so in most schools. Mahoney encourages anyone who feels passionate about police abolition to take advantage of the many activist groups or events on campus.

“The reason that I went to the march is because I’m privileged, I’m white, I’m middle class. The cops are here to protect me, but they’re not here to protect people that don’t look like me, or don’t have the same social status or economic status as me. And I think that people that have that privilege should use it to help people that don’t have the same privilege.”",748
Wealthy Countries are Hoarding COVID-19 Vaccines: How It Affects the Global South,"If there is one thing to be learned from this pandemic over the last year and a half, it’s the health care inequality the global south is currently facing. 

The world is in a vaccination race with COVID-19 — however, with over 80 percent of vaccines being distributed to wealthier countries, poorer countries are being left behind. Just 0.2 percent of the vaccines are administered to poor countries, leading many to criticize it as inaccessible, mirroring the wealth gap around the globe. 

Currently, 46.04 percent of the United States population has received one dose, whereas poorer countries like India only have 9.99 percent, and less than 1 percent of Guinea has had their first dose. In Santa Barbara County, 52.09 percent of residents have received their first dose of the vaccine. 

According to Tedros Adhanom, the general director of the World Health Organization (WHO), one in every four people in wealthier countries has received the COVID-19 vaccine, compared to one in more than 500 people in poorer countries. If this inequality continues, it is predicted that it’ll take at least two years for poorer countries to inoculate the majority of their population. This threatens the global population as the death toll is quickly increasing for poorer countries while the virus continually mutates. 

""THE WORLD IS IN A VACCINATION RACE WITH COVID-19 — HOWEVER, WITH OVER 80 PERCENT OF VACCINES BEING DISTRIBUTED TO WEALTHIER COUNTRIES, POORER COUNTRIES ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND.""

Some mechanisms that wealthier countries have — which allow them to have a surplus of vaccine supplies — are export control and the ability to deal with pharmaceutical companies. When there is an increasing supply of the vaccine, export restrictions may be placed to prevent vaccines from leaving borders.

In an interview with The Bottom Line (TBL), distinguished professor of global studies and sociology, Jan Nederveen Pieterse, said there are three main challenges in global vaccine distribution: intellectual property, vaccine production, and vaccine sharing. The biggest hurdle he shared is the intellectual property of vaccines as it dictates the course for vaccine production and eventually how the vaccine can be distributed. 

Professor Pieterse spoke of how the conversation surrounding vaccine sharing is in response to the idea of wealthy countries having a surplus of vaccines, and that they have more than they need. “How can we decentralize vaccine production?” Pieterse asked, suggesting that timing and production are still big obstacles to effective distribution.  

Patents are another major obstacle. Recently, the U.S. has proposed a temporary patent waiver for certain obligations under the agreement for COVID-19 vaccines. The waiver would allow other countries to produce the COVID-19 vaccine without facing any legal action from patent holders for the vaccine. As a result, supply would increase overall. Professor Pieterse explained if these waivers succeed, developing countries can also produce it. 

""“HOW CAN WE DECENTRALIZE VACCINE PRODUCTION?” PIETERSE ASKED, SUGGESTING THAT TIMING AND PRODUCTION ARE STILL BIG OBSTACLES TO EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION.""

“Because of patent issues held by pharmaceutical companies, India and other countries cannot use their production capacity because they don't have the right to produce it,” he explained.

Experts say that the longer it takes for the world to be vaccinated, the higher the chance vaccines will lose efficacy due to ongoing variants. The negotiation goes like this: countries would give pharmaceutical companies billions of dollars for research and development in exchange for priority access to vaccines.  

As Santa Barbara Country and other locations in the U.S. continue to vaccinate, the conversation surrounding the ethicality of our priority access grows as the virus continues to spread.

UCSB’s YDSA $900 Checks for Students,"On Saturday, May 8, the UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) chapter of the Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) held a “COVID Justice Campaign” on campus. The protest took place in a bid to pressure UCSB administrators to distribute millions of dollars left over from COVID-19 stimulus funding.

Originally, YDSA’s campaign started with a petition for all students to receive $400 based on $10 million of missing funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was passed in late March 2020. UCSB received approximately $25 million and allocated only about half of this amount as financial aid grants. 

Due to additional government COVID-19 relief funding passed in December of 2020 for colleges, YDSA is advocating for additional $500 stimulus payments from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund II (HEERF II) by the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA). 

In total, each eligible undergraduate student and graduate student at UCSB would receive a $900 financial aid grant from the CARES and CRRSAA funds. 

Beginning their event around 2 p.m., YDSA and its supporters congregated at Storke Plaza with pizza and Yerba Mates provided for protesters. 

Patrick Fairbanks, a fourth-year sociology major and the current secretary of UCSB YDSA, sat down for an interview with The Bottom Line before the event to explain why the organization is concerned with the fight for students’ livelihoods.

“We believe that the university should not be run like a business, but instead should be run like a public institution that is responsible [for] its students and faculty and staff to do what’s right by them,” said Fairbanks, in reference to the university’s refusal to lower tuition or reduce campus fees. 

“Only about 56 percent of students got checks at all in the first two rounds, which left almost half of the entire student body out,” he continued. 

UCSB’s Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships distributed both rounds of grants based on student FAFSA applications, with Pell Grant recipients receiving the largest amounts and non-Pell grant recipients with demonstrated financial need receiving smaller awards. The CARES Act legally requires a minimum of 50 percent of funds to be distributed as direct relief to students, while the CRRSAA Act requires institutions to prioritize students with exceptional financial need. 

Transparency is another aspect of the campaign that YDSA is concerned about, as requests for meetings and conversations about what the university plans to do with the remaining $22 million have been ignored or dismissed by administrators. In response, YDSA sent a demand letter directly to Chancellor Henry T. Yang three months ago, which was unanimously endorsed by UCSB’s Associated Students (AS) and its president.

""TRANSPARENCY IS ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE CAMPAIGN THAT YDSA IS CONCERNED ABOUT, AS REQUESTS FOR MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE UNIVERSITY PLANS TO DO WITH THE REMAINING $22 MILLION HAVE BEEN IGNORED OR DISMISSED BY ADMINISTRATORS.""

Additionally, organizations such as Food Not Bombs Isla Vista, the graduate student organization COLA/Cops Off Campus, and UAW 2865 — the union representing Academic Student Employees across the University of California system — are currently supporting YDSA with its campaign. 

At around 3 p.m., the protesters marched to Chancellor Yang’s on-campus home, where he lives free of cost while earning approximately $400,000 a year. Although the Chancellor was seemingly not inside and remained silent on the issue, YDSA opened the floor to speakers and students to air their grievances by chalking slogans on his driveway. 

In one of the speeches, Fairbanks criticized the university’s choices to spend money on its business interests — including raising administrative pay — while its student body struggles to afford rent and pay full tuition during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Toward the end of the event, Cody Nunn, a third-year political science major serving as YDSA’s treasurer, shared that the latest official response to the COVID Justice Campaign occurred the night before the march: “The administration let us know that they will not be sending us money.” 

“They said that they simply don’t have it, and that they need it to balance the books because they lost a lot of their revenue,” he continued. 

While the organization strongly doubts the university is willing to meet its demands, YDSA’s goal is to advocate for the transparency and accountability students deserve from administrators. For its next steps, YDSA is focused on spreading awareness and persisting in its efforts to have a conversation with UCSB administration and Chancellor Yang.   

“We want them to know that there are a lot of people who are willing to spend their days advocating for it and that it matters to that many people,” said Nunn. 


UCSB students who wish to support the COVID Justice Campaign may join YDSA by becoming a member of the Young Democratic Socialists of America or follow UCSB YDSA’s social media for future events and announcements.

"In Conversation with Newly-Elected AS President, Yuval Cohen","On April 22, Yuval Cohen won the Associated Students (AS) presidential election for the 2021-2022 academic school year. She ran with Storke Party, a new political AS party for UC Santa Barbara (UCSB).

Cohen, a third-year political science and philosophy double major, won with a 55:45 ratio in the race. She — along with Bee Schaefer, Shannon Sweeney, and Esmeralda Quintero-Cubillan — will run the AS Executive Board next year.

Storke Party first established its social media presence in February, but made its official public debut at the start of candidacy season. The party appears to have functionally replaced Campus United, which ceased posting on social media last year.

Storke’s branding focuses on increasing transparency within AS, promoting more resources for academic and career success, providing resources to meet essential needs, advocating for underrepresented communities and “[rising] towards greater accessibility.”

According to Cohen, running with Storke Party gave candidates a chance to create more individualized campaigns based on what they want to change on campus. This adjustment grants candidates more freedom in choosing what issues they want to address during their terms in office.

“I’d say that Storke Party focuses more on the greater student body than party ideals,” said Cohen in an interview with The Bottom Line. “We have platform points, but everyone has their own ideals.”

“HER GREATEST INSPIRATION FOR RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WAS BECOMING A VOICE FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. AS A FIRST-GENERATION AND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT, COHEN WANTS OTHER STUDENTS FROM THE SAME COMMUNITIES TO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE RESOURCES TO HELP THEM SUCCEED AT UC SANTA BARBARA.”

Cohen is currently serving as an off-campus senator and as the Basic Needs Committee Chair. This year, she had the opportunity to work on several projects geared towards making essential resources more accessible for students during the pandemic. Some highlights include collaborating with the vegan organization “Food – Not Bombs” in Isla Vista (I.V.), putting out emergency grants with the COVID-19 task force, working with CALPIRG on the zero-hunger campaign, and beginning the Basic Needs Resources Committee with AS. 

“I’m very passionate about [remediating] the effects of COVID-19,” said Cohen. “My platform is most focused on easing the transition back on campus next year.”

Her greatest inspiration for running for President was becoming a voice for underrepresented students. As a first-generation and undocumented student, Cohen wants other students from the same communities to know that they have resources to help them succeed at UC Santa Barbara. 

According to Cohen, being a first-generation and undocumented student introduced plenty of obstacles before she came to UCSB. First-generation students often navigate through obstacles such as completing college applications or finding a career path with little to no assistance. Undocumented students often lack sufficient support systems in high school. Cohen said that as an applicant to UCSB, she needed to complete all forms for admission and financial aid on her own.

“In high school, I didn’t even tell anyone that I was undocumented or first-generation,” recounted Cohen. “But coming into UCSB, I finally found all these other people that were the same as me. It made me proud to be part of that community.”

Going into her presidency, Yuval Cohen wants to renew a project that began in 2016 called the Five Year Plan. This plan would be based on what students want to change at UCSB and is spearheaded by the AS Vision task force.",1276
UC Santa Barbara Reopens the Recreation Center at Limited Capacity,"With Santa Barbara County finally falling into the less restrictive red-tier of the state’s reopening plan along with the lifting of the regional stay-at-home order, UC Santa Barbara’s (UCSB) Recreation Center (Rec Cen) has been approved by Chancellor Yang to begin its reopening with the ultimate goal of returning to normal, in-person activities. 

Since March of 2020, the Rec Cen had been closed due to UCSB shifting to online learning at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. While in-person services were unavailable, the Department of Recreation offered online programming to students such as “Get up Gauchos!” and virtual personal training. 

The Rec Cen will now be open beginning Monday, April 12. The first phase of the reopening plan requires reservations from UCSB students, faculty, and staff, as well as those with active Recreation Center memberships. Reservations are available Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and on the weekend from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m.

Patrons may reserve spaces in the large pool, the small pool, the outdoor climbing tower, and the outdoor fitness area. In accordance with California’s reopening guidelines, everyone who uses the Rec Cen’s outdoor fitness areas is required to wear a face covering at all times.

Equipment available in the outdoor fitness area will consist of “Cardio Equipment, Circuit Training Machine Weights, Schwinn Cycling Bikes, Squat Racks, Bench Presses, Dumbbell Racks, and Turf Area,” according to a campus-wide email sent out by the Department of Recreation during the first week of spring quarter.

However, reservations are not required for physically distanced activities at the “Rec Cen Fields, Tennis Courts, Pauley Track, and Storke Field,” as stated by a subsequent email of the department. 

The Rec Cen encourages students to cancel their reservations as soon as possible if they are unable to be present for their reserved time by going to the “Bookings” section under their profile. Multiple missed reservations result in revoked Rec Cen privileges. 

Further announcements in the email included important details about other recreational programs and services offered by the department. With the indoor Rec Cen facility remaining closed, lockers and showers at Rob Gym and the Multi-Activity Court will be unavailable to patrons throughout the spring quarter. 

Personal fitness training will be made available both in-person and online, while UCSB Adventure Programs will offer in-person activities during spring quarter such as campus point rentals, outdoor gear rentals, kayaking, and outdoor climbing. The Rec Cen’s passport services will also begin to offer limited single-person appointments at the start of May.

For students living away from campus, virtual programming and events will continue to be offered – excluding Gaucho Recreation & Exercise Classes. Besides signing up for fitness classes and events on Shoreline  — which is the official online campus engagement platform for UCSB — intramural e-sports and nutritional counseling will also be available. 

In preparation for a full reopening, the Department of Recreation is also offering employment opportunities for lifeguards, swim instructors, and junior guard instructors as well as surfing and kayaking instructors. Additionally, students are invited to apply as camp counselors for upcoming summer programs. 

In order to gain entry into any campus building, weekly COVID-19 testing and a daily COVID-19 Screening Survey must be completed by students. Both testing and this survey can be accessed through the Student Health Services portal. Students living, working, or taking classes on campus are already enrolled in these protocols. 

To access the Rec Cen, students must email sa-ucsb-covid19-it@ucsb.edu to become enrolled in the weekly COVID-19 testing and daily symptom survey. Completing the requirements on time will grant undergraduate students a green clearance badge on the Student Health portal in order to enter the facility.

"AS Campus Election Results Show Low Voter Turnouts, But High Hopes","Voting for UCSB’s Associated Student (AS) elections concluded on Thursday, April 22, and the results are in: Five executive positions and 26 legislative positions were filled. Additionally, a list of 33 reaffirmations and five new financial measures were voted on with a 5,122 undergraduate student turnout for the online election.

Undergraduate students showed a 24.16 percent voter turnout while graduate students showed a 24.78 percent turnout, surpassing the 20 percent voter threshold needed to validate the results. The undergraduate turnout showed a 4.68 percent drop from 2019’s election, marking it as the lowest voter turnout in the past six years. 

Storke Party member Avital Rutenburg, a newly-elected collegiate senator for the College of Letters & Science, said that voting declines in the past two years have been caused by off-campus learning due to Coronavirus.

“I think a lot of the freshmen feel very removed from UCSB,” Rutenburg said. “They have no idea who I am, and they don’t know what the campus looks like let alone what campus politics are.”

Voting capacity breached 20 percent only around two hours before voting concluded, according to Rutenburg. Despite a low voter turnout, the decisions were finalized.

Yuval Cohen, a third-year running as a representative of the Storke Party, was voted in as AS President. Cohen presented a breath of general and academic goals throughout her campaign, including expanding the AS COVID-19 Emergency Task Force Grant by reallocating more unused student funds back to students, growing the Mental Health Town Hall and mental health resources on campus, and implementing a 24-hour cafe on campus.

All vice president positions were filled by members of the Isla Vista Party, with Esmeralda Quintero-Cubillan taking external vice president of statewide affairs, Shannon Sweeney taking external vice president of local affairs, and Bee Schaefer taking over the internal vice president position.

Senator positions were more split, with 11 members of Isla Vista Party, 12 from Storke Party, and three independently running candidates taking on senator positions. For Rutenburg, choosing a party is incredibly beneficial while campaigning, but she hopes that the divisions between parties dissolve once elections conclude.

“The way I view it is that the second we step into the senator position we should just dissolve those party lines because now we’re all working together towards a common goal,” Rutenburg said. “We all have really similar values. And obviously we’re going to have different approaches and things that we prioritize, but at the end of the day we’re all representing each other too.”

AS additionally takes a part of all students’ tuitions to use for a breadth of student resources. Voting on the financial measures in this spring election allowed students to approve where their money is allocated to. All 33 of the financial measures being voted on this year were reaffirmed.

While Rutenburg encourages allocation of funds into programs such as the Multicultural Center, she believes that some of that money should have been returned to the student body. Due to the pandemic, many facilities including the Recreation Center weren’t being used to their full capacity. Rutenburg said that she assumes many students voted for the reaffirmations without reading them in depth, and may not have considered that they could have gotten some money back.

Rutenburg, along with her fellow elected officials, is optimistic about the upcoming year of on-campus learning. 

“I had a little bit of a decline when COVID hit because, like everyone, I felt kind of removed from the campus so it was hard for me to imagine making a tangible change on something that was so up in the air,” Rutenburg said. “But now that I have been wrapping my head around how we are going to be going back to an actual campus, now is the perfect opportunity to make change because everything is changing.”",769
UCSB’s Fall Vaccine Requirement,"The UC Office of the President has released a policy proposal calling for campus-wide COVID-19 vaccination requirements. The policy requests all UC personnel, trainees, and students who will be accessing university facilities to receive the COVID-19 vaccine before the start of the fall 2021 term. This mandate won’t be enforced until the full approval and widespread availability of at least one vaccine.

According to the proposal, the purpose of the policy is to protect the health and safety of the university community, which includes faculty, academic appointees, staff, trainees, students, and others who work, live, or learn on any of the nine UC campuses. Obtaining the COVID-19 vaccine is highly recommended for all members. 

There are exemptions in this policy, however. If a person holds a religious belief, practice, or observance of a traditionally recognized religion, then they can be exempted from the vaccine requirement. Requests for exceptions will be available if the plan is finalized and must be submitted to the authorized campus representatives. 

“THE POLICY REQUESTS ALL UC PERSONNEL, TRAINEES, AND STUDENTS WHO WILL BE ACCESSING UNIVERSITY FACILITIES TO RECEIVE THE COVID-19 VACCINE BEFORE THE START OF THE FALL 2021 TERM.”

This policy was proposed by the executive vice president, UC Health, and the executive vice president UC Operations (Campuses, ANR, Labs). 

Santa Barbara County has lowered the age limit of the COVID-19 Vaccine to 16 years old. Information on the COVID-19 Vaccination can be found at the UCSB Student Health website. ",822
Parties Continue as COVID-19 Vaccine Eligibility Expands,"With declining COVID-19 case numbers, Santa Barbara County has joined the majority of California’s counties in moving from the red tier of California’s Blueprint for a Safer Economy to the orange tier, allowing businesses such as restaurants and movie theaters to operate indoors at a 50 percent capacity. Additionally, all residents 16 years of age and older are now eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. 

This comes after the county spent a large part of the COVID-19 lockdown in the most restrictive purple tier, with intensive care unit availability below 15 percent. The county has also had 33,926 positive cases and 445 deaths as indicated by the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department’s (SBCPHD) status report on April 20. 

Despite alarming rises in case numbers, students at UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) continued to throw parties during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, partygoers have become even less concerned about safety with the vaccine no longer restricted to certain groups of individuals.

Mikah Jackson, a third-year anthropology major, shared her frustrations upon first finding out that large gatherings were being held in Isla Vista: “Honestly, I thought it was so embarrassing for these people.” 

“Also, I think it showed people’s true colors,” she continued. “Especially those who just brazenly posted on social media for everyone to see while numbers were still rising.” 

In regards to the increase in partying seen during the first weekend of spring quarter — known as Deltopia — Jackson still finds it frustrating since the county has not yet reached herd immunity, which will be accomplished once 80 to 90 percent of the population has received the vaccine. 

Currently, only 23 percent of the county’s residents have been fully vaccinated and approximately half of its residents have received their first dose, according to a KCSB News COVID-19 newsletter emailed on April 21.

Kimberly Duarte, a fourth-year English major, echoed similar sentiments about seeing more frequent partying in light of COVID-19 vaccine availability: “I continue to think that it’s pretty irresponsible and selfish to be throwing and attending parties at the moment.” 

“We should have stuck to small and intimate gatherings,” she added. While many activities are now safe to participate in with full immunization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strongly advises against medium to large indoor gatherings. 

Furthermore, an individual is only considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose of Pfizer or Moderna, or two weeks after the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The vaccines are also not 100 percent effective, and experts are still determining if vaccinated individuals are able to transmit the virus despite not developing disease. 

“I don’t even think the people that were throwing parties before they were allowed to get the vaccine are rushing to get it now that it’s available,” added Duarte in regards to the careless behavior she has witnessed. 

“I don’t even think the people that were throwing parties before they were allowed to get the vaccine are rushing to get it now that it’s available,” added Duarte in regards to the careless behavior she has witnessed. “

Another concern for both students is that those who continued partying despite increasing case numbers downplayed the severity of the virus to the point that they are not waiting to become fully immune if they have received a COVID-19 vaccine.  

“It’s really deceitful to use the vaccine as an excuse to party now when your actions have been putting people’s lives in danger the whole time,” said Jackson. “Like, really? There are people dying and you can’t stop partying?” 

Many who have attended parties at UCSB have also justified their actions by claiming immunity after recovering from a COVID-19 infection. While antibodies may provide protection from the virus, it is unknown how long these antibodies last and how much protection they provide. 

A study of 156 healthcare workers with COVID-19 antibodies found that 94 percent of participants declined in antibodies after 60 days and 28 percent experienced a significant drop.

Because of this, the CDC still recommends that individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 still get vaccinated in order to be fully protected from all strains of the virus. They may only need a single dose.

The COVID-19 vaccine is free of cost and available to everyone regardless of health insurance coverage or immigration status. Individuals seeking further information and appointments may visit the SBCPHD’s COVID-19 Vaccine Information page.",771
Isla Vista Regains Sense of Normalcy with Vaccine Rollout,"As the availability of COVID-19 vaccines expands, a more hopeful future approaches for UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) students. On April 6, Santa Barbara County Public Health officials announced that any Santa Barbara resident 16 and over is eligible for the vaccine. 

The broadening of vaccination groups is a major contribution to UCSB’s campus reopening in the fall 2021 school year. On April 16, Chancellor Yang sent an email to all UCSB students to announce plans for in-person classes next school year. 

According to Yang, “the increasing availability of vaccines, significant decrease in California’s infection rate, and Governor Gavin Newsom’s aspirational announcement that the state is expected to ‘fully reopen’ in June” has allowed for an optimistic future for UCSB.

According to the LA Times, over 45 percent of California residents have at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Many UCSB students are amongst that expanding population. Those who have been vaccinated can attest to their experience with getting the vaccine and how it has affected their mindsets surrounding the pandemic.

Third-year Mehgan Dunn got her first dose of the Moderna vaccine in mid-March at the Hilton Hotel in downtown Santa Barbara, and received her second dose two weeks ago. The first dose made her lethargic, and the second dose made her arm sore for a few days. Despite this, Dunn had relatively minor side effects to the vaccine.

“AS THE AVAILABILITY OF COVID-19 VACCINES EXPANDS, A MORE HOPEFUL FUTURE APPROACHES FOR UC SANTA BARBARA (UCSB) STUDENTS. ON APRIL 6, SANTA BARBARA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THAT ANY SANTA BARBARA RESIDENT 16 AND OVER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE VACCINE.”

Dunn currently lives in Isla Vista (I.V.) with five other housemates, all of whom are now partially or fully vaccinated. Dunn said that she and her housemates have been conscious of who they interact with throughout the pandemic, but the emergence of the vaccine has made them more comfortable.

“We’re definitely much less anxious seeing people I don’t know or people I’m not close with,” Dunn said. “And I think everyone feels that way, since we’re vaccinated we’re more comfortable returning to normalcy.”

Dunn has also noticed a shift in I.V.’s culture, as she has watched many of her peers begin to interact in larger groups more frequently.

“I feel like people are definitely getting more comfortable having large parties from what I’ve seen on social media, and I am hearing about less cases so that’s good. It’s still unsure, but I feel like the culture in I.V. has shifted because I just feel like it’s less on people’s minds now and less of a worry,” Dunn said.

Maddie Bacon, a third-year UCSB student, had more intense side effects following her first dose of the Moderna vaccine. Bacon reported feeling tired, achy, and feverish the day following the first dose. Her arm remained sore and difficult to use for a few days.

“ACCORDING TO THE LA TIMES, OVER 45 PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF THE COVID-19 VACCINE. MANY UCSB STUDENTS ARE AMONGST THAT EXPANDING POPULATION.”

However, Bacon has also seen the overall shift in the culture of I.V. as more students are getting vaccinated.

“I think that students are able to see each other more when everyone’s vaccinated,” Bacon said. “There’s a feeling of relief throughout I.V. because it’s not so immoral to see friends or other people, and I haven’t met anyone who’s been opposed to being vaccinated.”

Both Bacon and Dunn are optimistic about the future and are looking forward to the reopening of I.V. culture and campus for the upcoming school year.

“I’m just excited to take a class, to go into a building, to feel like a student, and also just being on campus with people and feeling the return to normal life,” Dunn said. “And I’m excited to not have to worry all the time.”",864
New Senate Bill Demands Transparency from Greek Organizations,"Associated Students (AS) Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) recently announced that they have co-authored Assembly Bill 524 (AB 524), also known as the Greek A.C.T. (Accountability, Change, Transparency). 

SASA is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization “dedicated to the elimination of sexual assault and sexual harassment on the University of California, Santa Barbara, the Santa Barbara City College, the University of California, Santa Cruz campuses and their surrounding communities.”

Assemblymember Freddie Rodriguez, a representative of the 52nd state district, reintroduced the legislation to the CA State Assembly to begin passing the bill. Previously, the legislation was introduced to the Higher Education Committee and passed as AB 1155 with plans to add amendments. 

The amendments included in state bill AB 524 require higher-education institutions to publicly report information on outcomes of allegations of misconduct and the number of citations and disciplinary actions relating to sexual assault incidents regarding campus-affiliated sororities and fraternities. 

Greek organizations must also include information on the number of active and new members, the average GPA of all members, charitable fundraising and volunteer hours, and the current conduct and recognition status of the organization. 

“With more transparency, students and families can make informed decisions about the social and professional organizations they choose to invest time, resources, and personal safety into joining,” said Rodriguez in a press release. 

AB 524 is also co-sponsored by the UC Student Association, an official organization that advocates and takes direct action on behalf of all UC students. 

“THE AMENDMENTS INCLUDED IN STATE BILL AB 524 REQUIRE HIGHER-EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO PUBLICLY REPORT INFORMATION ON OUTCOMES OF ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT AND THE NUMBER OF CITATIONS AND DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS RELATING TO SEXUAL ASSAULT INCIDENTS REGARDING CAMPUS-AFFILIATED SORORITIES AND FRATERNITIES.”

Both UCSA and SASA are proudly sponsoring the Greek A.C.T. in hopes that transparency from fraternities and sororities will mitigate the persistent issues of hazing, sexual violence, and excessive drinking. The culture perpetuated by Greek life through these actions has led to harmful – even lethal – repercussions for the students affected. 

While sororities and fraternities offer a sense of community for students, Greek organizations have a history of a lack of transparency and accountability regarding sexual violence and alcohol abuse. 

At UCSB, three fraternities and one sorority have lost their recognition status since 2014 due to hazing and alcohol-related incidents against the university’s policy. 

At UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) recently saw several instances of sexual assault during the beginning of the fall quarter in 2019. In October of that year, two attempted assaults at fraternity Sigma Pi occurred within the same night. After reports to the president of Sigma Pi, a second-year student’s membership was revoked. 

“WHILE SORORITIES AND FRATERNITIES OFFER A SENSE OF COMMUNITY FOR STUDENTS, GREEK ORGANIZATIONS HAVE A HISTORY OF A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY REGARDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND ALCOHOL ABUSE.”

Many UCSB students expressed frustration that the perpetrator’s name would be kept confidential due to protections offered by Title IX, which keep the perpetrator’s identity private in order to protect the survivor’s identity. 

Within the same month, a timely warning released by UCSB Alerts detailed two incidents of date rape drugs at an unnamed fraternity party taking place two days later. The e-mail reported that the university administration had additional information that there may have been more incidents of “incapacitating agents” at other parties hosted by fraternities. 

Later, the UCSB Police Department released another timely warning about a rape occurring at the Sigma Pi fraternity house on Oct. 26. While details about the suspect’s physical description were shared with the public, there was once again a lack of transparency regarding the perpetrator. 

The actions of education and suspension enacted by the university, the Interfraternity Council, and the fraternity’s national headquarters during the investigation seem, to many community members, to be a temporary solution to rape culture on college campuses. For instance, UCSB’s Sigma Pi fraternity is still active and advertising spring recruitment events on social media along with other fraternities who may have been involved in previous incidents. 

SASA continues to work with Assemblymember Freddie Rodriguez on the passage of AB 524 and will soon release further information on their website and social media for how the community can help to enact the bill. 

UCSB students wishing to discuss an instance of sexual assault or interpersonal violence may access confidential survivor resources through UCSB’s Campus Advocacy, Resources, and Education (CARE). ",742
Davidson Library Officially Reopens,"Just in time for National School Library Month, UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) has opened Davidson Library for the first time since the COVID-19 closure last spring. The library is currently operating at 25 percent capacity on a reservation-only basis. 

The decision to open Davidson Library comes in conjunction with UCSB’s current reopening plan, announced by Chancellor Yang in a student-wide email last week. As cases have largely declined since the COVID-19 spike in January, possibilities for reopening all of campus in the fall have become more tangible, with the recreation center’s reopening already underway. Santa Barbara County has recently descended into the orange tier, the second most severe COVID-19 tier. UCSB anticipates that with more vaccinations and consistent safety regulations, we can make it to the yellow tier later on.

The library has been open since March 29, and as of April 18, about 31.5 percent of Santa Barbara County residents over the age of 16 have been fully vaccinated. The amount of fully vaccinated residents has been steadily increasing throughout the last couple of months and will further expand as per the recent announcement that anyone over the age of 16 in Santa Barbara County can receive the vaccine.

However, the library is still exercising caution in reopening. Every student that plans to use the library must wear a face covering at all times and complete a COVID-19 screening survey before entering the building, as well as weekly COVID tests with Student Health Services. All seats are spaced at least nine feet apart and are for single use only. All group study rooms have been repurposed for graduate students individually conducting remote research and study. Users can still access GauchoPrint services as they could during the school year. Restrooms, as well as a lactation room, will also be accessible.

“JUST IN TIME FOR NATIONAL SCHOOL LIBRARY MONTH, UC SANTA BARBARA (UCSB) HAS OPENED DAVIDSON LIBRARY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE COVID-19 CLOSURE LAST SPRING. THE LIBRARY IS CURRENTLY OPERATING AT 25 PERCENT CAPACITY ON A RESERVATION-ONLY BASIS.”

The first two levels of the library’s mountain side are the only floors currently open for use. UCSB plans to open the ascending floors in phases, all according to how the pandemic progresses. 

So far, students and employees alike have been satisfied with the library reopening. Being able to access a consistently quiet study space has been greatly appreciated by students who do not have the same luxury within their own apartments around campus. The reopening process itself, according to one of the library employees, has also been relatively smooth.

“The reopening has gone well so far,” said Teddy Weber, a student employee at the library. “Slight hiccups have occurred due to glitches in the system when trying to obtain a green badge that is needed to enter the library, but the department responsible for the badges [has] been very reliable in [helping] students during hours when the library is open.”

UCSB students and faculty can make library reservations up to two weeks in advance, and users will be able to schedule up to 15 hours per week. Click here to find a seat.",823
AS Campus Elections,"The UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) spring 2021 campus elections will be open for voting starting April 19 and will close April 21. The elections are guided by the Campus Elections Commission (CEC) and will allow both undergraduate and graduate students to vote on measures surrounding school fees. 

A 20 percent voter turnout will be required to validate the election and participation allows students to better understand where their money is being allocated. Students are urged to carefully review each organization’s proposed measures before voting for any mandatory service fees. Strong support or opposition towards any measure can be submitted to the CEC as a Pro/Con Statement. 

This spring’s election brings five measures to the table for students deciding to vote. Two proposed fees are applicable to undergraduate students exclusively, while the other three are open to both undergraduate and graduate students.

The first measure requests the continuation of a quarterly $5.85 student service fee that supports the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP). EOP offers a retention service meant to guide undergraduate students in their transition into the university, their academic career, and their post-grad future. 

While EOP focuses on first-generation and low-income students, all undergraduates are welcome to utilize their resources. EOP provides counselors for mentoring students, sponsors collaborative student programs for the UCSB community, and works to strengthen on-campus issues such as the retention and graduation of first-generation students.

The proposed fee aims to continue student retention efforts and will fund academic, social, and cultural EOP programs. 

The next measure asks undergraduate students to pay $0.89 per quarter for the Student Medical Emergencies Relief Fund (SMERF). SMERF provides funds for students unable to cover their emergency medical, dental, or optical care.

“THE UC SANTA BARBARA (UCSB) SPRING 2021 CAMPUS ELECTIONS WILL BE OPEN FOR VOTING STARTING APRIL 19 AND WILL CLOSE APRIL 21. THE ELECTIONS ARE GUIDED BY THE CAMPUS ELECTIONS COMMISSION (CEC) AND WILL ALLOW BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS TO VOTE ON MEASURES SURROUNDING SCHOOL FEES.”

The third measure covers UCSB’s Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) fee and a support fee for Career Services. Both undergraduate and graduate students can vote on this measure. CAPS and Career Services are asking for a continued mandatory fee of $5.85 per quarter to continue aiding students with any mental health or emotional distress issues, as well as offering services for career exploration.

A $2.69 fee will be aimed towards CAPS to fund psychologists, staff, and professional services. The other $3.16 will go towards funding career counselors,other staff, and online career tools.

The fourth measure is also offered to undergraduate and graduate students. It is a $7.13 fee for the Health and Wellness Program, which offers over 90 research-based programs on wellness topics such as healthy eating, drugs, stress reduction, sex, and relationships. According to the CEC’s spring election pamphlet, these programs help up to 330 students annually.

Additional funds towards the Health & Wellness Program will allow weekly resources for students at no additional cost; continuing the program’s goal of providing academic, physical, social, and emotional support.

The final measure available for undergraduate and graduate student voting will be a fee of $8.17 for the Women, Gender & Sexual Equity (WGSE) support fee. WGSE supports services and programs on campus that help people who may be facing challenges due to their identity.

The additional fee will aid in maintaining programs within the Women’s Center, Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE), the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), and Non-Traditional Student Resource Centers. The addition of technology and library acquisitions will be implemented, and WSGE will improve its current programs with the additional funds.

The CEC has sent further information on how students can act on their ability to vote for campus elections through email. The link to vote can be found at https://vote.as.ucsb.edu.",972
Cluster of COVID-19 Cases Forces Women’s Water Polo to Cancel Season,"On April 6, UC Santa Barbara’s (UCSB) Emergency Alert System sent out a campus-wide notification announcing a cluster of 10 positive COVID-19 cases in “members of an Intercollegiate Athletics team.”

“The impacted individuals are self-isolating and have not used any campus facilities since March 25, 2021,” read the email. “UC Santa Barbara has canceled the remainder of the season for the affected team, effective immediately.” 

Public health officials from the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department are working closely with university administrators regarding contact tracing efforts for the incident. Officials will reach out to any individuals in the community who may have been in contact with members of the athletic team who tested positive for COVID-19. 

While the email failed to specify the affected team, the UCSB athletics website confirmed that the women’s water polo team canceled their 2021 season as a result of COVID-19 concerns. 

“It is unfortunate that we needed to take this action,” said UCSB Director of Athletics John McCutcheon in a statement posted to the school’s athletics website. “But circumstances forced our decision. We will continue to support the team as we progress through this difficult situation,” he continued.

Out of the eight matches played during the women’s water polo season, the team’s 2021 schedule indicates that they won three matches and lost five matches. Additionally, a match against the University of Hawai’i on Sunday was canceled along with two other scheduled games at Long Beach State planned for the following weekend.

Previously, the Big West Conference postponed all fall sports during the summer of 2020 but approved winter and spring sports under the condition that adherence to COVID-19 health and safety guidelines were to be followed. 

“IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT WE NEEDED TO TAKE THIS ACTION,” SAID UCSB DIRECTOR OF ATHLETICS JOHN MCCUTCHEON IN A STATEMENT POSTED TO THE SCHOOL’S ATHLETICS WEBSITE. “BUT CIRCUMSTANCES FORCED OUR DECISION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE TEAM AS WE PROGRESS THROUGH THIS DIFFICULT SITUATION,” HE CONTINUED.”

The National Collegiate Athletic Association classifies water polo athletes as Tier 1 personnel in their Return to Championships Guidelines, which provides sport-specific recommendations for preliminary rounds and championships based on guidance from the federal government and health agencies. Frequent testing and mask-wearing are extremely important because these are high-exposure individuals, as “physical distancing and face coverings are not possible or effective during athletic training or competition.”

Although the reason for the positive case cluster was withheld by UCSB, a potential cause could be traced to out-of-town travel during the recent spring break. It is also possible that gatherings held in honor of Deltopia weekend — which traditionally takes place during the first weekend of spring quarter — could have contributed to the COVID-19 cases.

According to a report released by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, a total of 20 citations were issued and five arrests were made during Deltopia weekend from April 2 to April 4. The Instagram account @ucsb.party also shared several videos showing footage of large gatherings held on Saturday, April 3. 

Hosting “mountain parties” has also become a popular way of having large gatherings during the pandemic that allows partygoers to avoid law enforcement. Usually by invitation only, a host shares coordinates for locations in the Santa Ynez mountains to partygoers, who are then allowed to bring guests along with them. 

The most recent mountain party took place on Deltopia weekend, starting around 10 p.m. and ending at around 6 a.m. These large gatherings include live music and have been hosted throughout the COVID-19 lockdown, which may have contributed to the spread of COVID-19 in the UCSB community. 

Individuals with any questions or concerns relating to the university’s response to COVID-19 should contact the COVID-19 Call Center. Hours of operation and contact information may be found on UCSB’s COVID-19 Campus Information page. ",1024
UC-Wide Data Hack Outrages Students,"On March 31, UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) students experienced a security breach on the school network. This attack was part of a larger nationwide security breach affecting 300 organizations. It affected not only schools within the UC system, but schools nationwide including the University of Miami, the University of Colorado, and the Stanford School of Medicine.

The university sent out an official statement on April 2 detailing the incident. Administrators believe that potentially stolen data includes birth dates, Social Security Numbers (SSN), and bank account information. Even students’ family members’ information may be at risk, according to the FAQs released by UCNet on April 5. 

The FAQs also state that the university is currently working with federal law enforcement and other third-party programs to investigate the attack and develop preventative measures for the future.

The university recommends that students sign up with the credit bureau Experian to protect against future cyber attacks. Despite the efforts to keep students’ information secure, students say that their trust in the university is waning as a result of the recent problem.

The cyber attack came as a mass email sent to many, but not all UCSB students. It included an online link and a message threatening to publish personal data belonging to the recipient on the dark web.

While the perpetrator remains unknown, the hacker has been reported to use the program Accellion in the incident. Accellion is a web security company that allows its clients to control third-party communication, simplify security, and monitor sensitive data coming and going through the client’s database. In the data breach, every affected organization used Accellion to protect their network. 

Currently, Accellion is facing 14 different lawsuits for the recent data breach. One lawsuit, which involves Accellion and the company Kroger, alleges that key people within Accellion have acknowledged that the file transfer appliance (FTA) that is included in their security package is outdated — being about 20 years old.

The Kroger lawsuit asserts that Joel York, the Chief Marketing Officer of Accellion, confirmed that Accellion is “encouraging its clients to discontinue use of FTA because it does not protect against modern data breaches.” The same FTA software faced a cyber-attack in February as well. 

Students are calling for UCSB to implement more secure programs to protect against any web attacks in the future. A discussion on r/UCSantaBarbara directs the blame not only on Accellion for failing to update their software, but also on UCSB for failing to choose a stronger security provider.

“Although it’s an Accellion product that [had vulnerabilities] in it, the UC protected the very sensitive data on millions of students and faculty with a shitty out-of-date piece of software from the early 2000s,” commented an anonymous user on the post. “I’m not an IT person, but this seems grossly negligent.”

UCSB administrators advise students to closely monitor their bank and SSN data if they suspect they have been affected by the cyber-attack.",1173
Breaking: Apply for the COVID-19 Grant,"UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) students can now apply for a COVID-19 relief grant. The grant was created by the Associated Students (AS) Human Rights Board, the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs, and AS Lobby Corps to support undergraduate students who have been impacted by the virus. The AS president also employed the AS COVID-19 Response Task Force to make the grant possible.

Students who previously applied for an AS COVID-19 Grant and received a grant during the fall or winter quarter are ineligible. The board is offering grants on a need basis with a maximum request of $750 that the response task force distributes. 

Students who are applying for the AS COVID-19 Grant this spring must show detailed proof of expenses and must complete the form. Forms are now available to fill up online and any questions can be addressed to hrbcochair@as.ucsb.edu. Applications are due on April 16 at 11:59 p.m. 

The UCSB Financial Crisis Response Team offers more resources for students who are experiencing a financial crisis such as rent payments, down payments, utility payments, or food insecurity. Students are able to contact the UCSB Financial Crisis Response Team via email and will be asked questions about their financial crisis/situation. An advisor will be provided for the process. Check out the website for more information.  ",768
UCSB Marriage Pact,"In the last week of February, an organization called the UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) Marriage Pact took the student body by storm. With over 4,000 entries in total, the marriage pact is one of a few creative ways that students have tried to uplift spirits during the pandemic.

According to the UCSB Marriage Pact Instagram, the survey implements “groundbreaking algorithms and a bit of linear algebra” to find a quintessential match for each participant. The survey contains 50 questions overall, mainly asking about things like family values, political preferences, and the participant’s goals.

By using a questionnaire based more heavily on beliefs and attitudes than simple hobbies, the marriage pact places more importance on mutual values than mutual interests when finding a match. According to Dr. Suzanne Degges-White, a writer for Psychology Today, finding someone with the same values is key to forming a lasting bond with anyone, especially a romantic partner. There are seven core values that define a relationship, which include caring for one another, avoiding harm, enjoyment, personal success, maturity, self-direction, and security. 

The marriage pact emulates a project undertaken by two economics students, Sophia Sterling-Angus and Liam McGregor, at Stanford in 2017. The students sought to create a simple and effective formula to find one’s perfect partner. Inspired by the difficulties of exclusive dating that many college students face today, the marriage pact aims to give students a new platform to meet someone in a romantic context.

“THE UCSB MARRIAGE PACT IS LARGELY SELF-AWARE, NOT HOPING TO MAKE PERMANENT MATCHES, BUT TO SIMPLY CONNECT PEOPLE WITH THEIR MOST COMPATIBLE POTENTIAL PARTNERS.”

“[The students] combined rigorous academic theory from psychology, market design, and computer science to design a 10-minute questionnaire any students could complete,” states the organization’s website. “Running every response through a custom matching algorithm, they could give each participant the name of their best match on campus.”

Based on comments from the original Facebook post advertising the survey, most students who took the survey did so out of pure curiosity. The UCSB Marriage Pact is largely self-aware, not hoping to make permanent matches, but to simply connect people with their most compatible potential partners. Some students thought the pact was silly and vocally refused to participate.

The pact, despite its name, does not necessarily encourage its participants to pursue something permanent with their matches. While several couples have actually been created by it — one even getting married with the original Stanford pact — the test mainly seems to be a test of curiosity.

“It was a cute idea,” said Cassandra Chow, a third-year music composition major. “But for some of my friends, no one ever got messaged.”

As matches poured in, some students reached out to their matches via email — while others chose not to reach out to their matches at all, simply taking the test for fun or to see what they got. ",1191
Santa Barbara County Lowers COVID-19 Vaccine Age Restrictions,"The State of California has been offering COVID-19 Vaccination since December 2020. There are two vaccines available, Moderna and Pfizer, which require two doses over a span of two weeks. The first batch of vaccines went to healthcare workers on the front line, like doctors and nurses. 

In Santa Barbara County, people who are eligible, which include individuals age 65 years and older, residents in the following sectors: health care, education, childcare, emergency services, food and agricultural, public transit, and people ages 16-64 with high-risk medical conditions are now able to obtain their COVID-19 vaccine. 

In order to check eligibility, everyone can check California’s vaccine scheduling website to see if they are eligible to obtain the vaccine. There are many clinics and hospitals that offer the vaccine such as the Cottage Valley Health Goleta or Santa Barbara, Sansum Clinic, CVS, Vons, and many more pharmacies and clinics. 

According to the UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) Student Health, if a student, either an undergraduate or graduate, is an employee of the campus then the student is eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines as are individuals ages 16 and above with certain significant, high-risk medical conditions or disabilities. UCSB Student Health offers vaccines through invitation or the student can schedule an appointment through California’s vaccine scheduling website. 

In the Cottage Valley Health Goleta drive up, the process, which includes a questionnaire and vaccination, takes about 5-10 minutes. Afterward, you are instructed to park for 15 minutes to make sure there will be no side effects such as itching, shortness of breath, etc. After the 15 minutes is over, you obtain a vaccination card and will be contacted for the second dose in the future. 

As of Monday, Santa Barbara County has lifted eligibility restrictions to obtain a dose of the vaccine. Anyone over the age of 16 can sign up for an appointment on the Santa Barbara County Public Health website.",610
Chancellor Yang Announces Fall Re-Opening Plan,"Last week, Chancellor Henry T. Yang sent out a campus-wide email updating the UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) community on the university’s plans to return to normal campus instruction. 

While the announcement confirmed that UCSB will continue with remote instruction through spring of 2021 with only certain courses in a face-to-face format, plans are underway to re-open campus for normal in-person instruction for the upcoming fall quarter. 

Chancellor Yang also disclosed that there will be a delayed release of official details regarding the virtual commencement ceremony for 2021 graduates. This is due to the possibility of a hybrid ceremony that only graduating students would be permitted to attend. 

“We are also keeping in mind our extraordinary graduates from 2020, and we are still planning to invite them back to campus for an in-person recognition ceremony in the future when the situation permits,” added the campus-wide email. 

The rescheduled date for the in-person celebration of last year’s class is yet to be announced, but the Associated Students (AS) Program Board extended an invitation to a future Extravaganza concert for the class of 2020 graduates — a concert funded by student lock-in fees of around $400 per quarter. However, this was not confirmed for 2021 graduates in Chancellor Yang’s e-mail.

“WHILE THE ANNOUNCEMENT CONFIRMED THAT UCSB WILL CONTINUE WITH REMOTE INSTRUCTION THROUGH SPRING OF 2021 WITH ONLY CERTAIN COURSES IN A FACE-TO-FACE FORMAT, PLANS ARE UNDERWAY TO RE-OPEN CAMPUS FOR NORMAL IN-PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR THE UPCOMING FALL QUARTER. “

Chancellor Yang also shared details about potentially re-opening the Davidson Library and the Recreation Center in a limited capacity for UCSB students. However, many students feel that this will risk reopening plans for the fall, seeing as the university is still in Phase 1B of vaccine administration, which only covers employees 65 years of age or older. 

“I would be more inclined to have those places open in fall of 2021 as opposed to spring of 2021 just because the campus already plans on being fully reopened for fall quarter,” said Olivia Gonzales, a third-year environmental studies major. 

“That’s also under the assumption that all the students and faculty will have vaccines by that point so that keeps everyone safe,” she added.  

Students also doubt whether this will happen since the winter quarter is almost over and UCSB’s upcoming spring break may lead to a surge in COVID-19 cases for students who travel out-of-town. 

“I feel like at this point, they’re continuing to give us false hope,” said Julie Winzelberg, a fourth-year communication major.

“MORE FREQUENT TESTING WILL LOWER THE ADJUSTED CASE RATE AND HELP THE COUNTY HEAD TOWARDS RE-OPENING BUSINESSES.”

Dr. Laura Polito, a member of the UCSB COVID-19 Response Team, held a mandatory COVID-19 conversation last Thursday for members of the Panhellenic community, which represents nine Greek sororities at UCSB. Winzelberg, who is a member of a Panhellenic sorority, shared what she learned from the presentation.

“She said that they can’t officially make plans for it to be open until we get out of the purple tier,” Winzelberg said in reference to planning for ventilation systems and deciding which entrances would be closed off for the buildings. 

California’s Blueprint for a Safer Economy determines color-coded tiers for a county based on the test positivity rate as well as the amount of daily new cases per 100,000 people in the population – also known as the adjusted case rate. Currently, Santa Barbara County has an adjusted case rate of 16.9. 

For this reason, Dr. Polito strongly recommends that more students take advantage of UCSB’s free weekly testing, which will allow the Santa Barbara County Public Health to more accurately identify the number of negative cases. More frequent testing will lower the adjusted case rate and help the county head towards re-opening businesses. 

Based on the blueprint’s criteria, Santa Barbara County needs to have an adjusted case rate below 7.0 to move from the purple tier into a less restrictive tier. This requires residents of the county to continue following social distancing guidelines and wearing masks – or double-masking – until the vaccine is accessible to everyone. 

To preserve enough doses for all qualified individuals, UCSB encourages its eligible students, staff, and faculty to first consult with their primary care providers for the vaccine so that individuals can receive it in a more timely manner. ",1413
UC Student Association Campaigns to Double the Pell Grant,"This past week, the UC Student Association (UCSA) advocated for their Double the Pell Grant Campaign by holding a press conference, a UCSA briefing to Congress members with UC President Michael V. Drake, a social media day of action, and a #DoublethePell Instagram live.

According to the California Student Aid Commission, the state has distributed 78,210 Pell Grant awards to UC students. The maximum award amount for the 2021-2022 school year is projected to be around $6,495 for the entire academic year.

In a virtual press conference, UCSA president Aidan Arasasingham, a fourth-year global studies major at UC Los Angeles (UCLA), explained: “at UC, more than 35 percent of all undergraduates receive Pell Grants. Within five years of graduating, the median income of Pell Grant recipients exceeds that of their families.” 

The Pell Grant generates a great deal of economic mobility for students in marginalized communities who do not share the same educational opportunities as the rest of the student population. 

The Pell Grant, founded in 1965, once covered 79 percent of public four-year institution expenses, which included tuition, housing, and other educational fees. Today, the Pell Grant only covers 28 percent of these academic expenses. When adjusted to UC Santa Barbara’s (UCSB) standard student expenses, even a person who receives the maximum Pell Grant amount would still need at least about $25,505 to be covered by other grants or student loans, wages, and personal savings. 

This disparity reflects how the increases in educational expenses over the past few decades have disproportionately exceeded increases in federal student aid. Similar disparities appear when comparing the modern minimum wage to college expenses. In 1980, students would have needed to work only 19 hours a week at minimum wage to afford both tuition and housing at UCSB. This year, some students would need to work more than 71 hours a week for the same amenities.

“Today, the Pell Grant only covers 28 percent of these academic expenses.”

To keep their expenses paid off, students often work exhausting hours while maintaining their academic careers. Some students, such as Rakia White, a transfer student from UC Berkeley, report feeling as though they cannot take full advantage of their academic experience while working and trying to finance school. 

“I felt like I couldn’t engage in my coursework as I wanted to because of all the work I was taking on,” explained White in an interview with the UC Press Room. Though the Pell Grant aims to make college more affordable, it is clear that it does not provide enough for students to have a well-balanced college life where their primary concern is their academics.

Because the monetary value of the Pell Grant has plummeted so significantly over the past decades, UCSA is collaborating with the UC Student Advocacy network; the National College Attainment Network; and most importantly, the UC system itself, in order to raise the grant amounts. 

“ACCORDING TO STUDENT TESTIMONIALS FROM UCSA, THE CURRENT PELL GRANT IS MOST HELPFUL FOR LOW-INCOME STUDENTS WHO EARN THEIR PRIMARY EDUCATIONAL FUNDING FROM THE PELL GRANT.”

Many students use their financial aid funds to pay for basic living necessities. On a livestream conducted by UCSA, Courtney Linzner, a third-year student from UCLA, said that living costs consume nearly all of her federal aid.

“It’s so expensive to live in LA, and it’s not even accounted for in my [federal aid],” explained Linzner on the livestream. She believes that within federal aid packages, distributors should adjust award amounts according to the costs of living within the area surrounding the school. 

The campaign specifically calls for an incremental program to increase the Pell Grant amount for three years until the current amount is doubled. Amounts would rise to $8,663 in 2022, $10,831 in 2023, and finally $13,000 in 2024. 

Doubling the Pell Grant would cover nearly half of all student expenses if approved by Congress. According to student testimonials from UCSA, the current Pell Grant is most helpful for low-income students who earn their primary educational funding from the Pell Grant. 

According to Linzner, financial aid was the main determinant in her college of choice. As a first generation college student, her aid was instrumental in granting her, as well as other students from marginalized backgrounds, opportunities for education and growth. ",2973
Indigenous Protestors Arrested for Defending Sacred Chumash Land,"Early Thursday morning, protesters stood at the entrance of the San Marcos Foothills Preserve to prevent new construction of a proposed luxury home development site on sacred Chumash land. Eight people were arrested that morning, six of which were indigenous Chumash women. 

The protest was organized by the Save the San Marcos Foothills group, which publicized the sit-in on their Instagram page.

The protestors circled in front of the foothill gates, singing Chumash chants and words of encouragement. Two of the protestors tied themselves to a pole that stood in the idling bulldozer’s way. They were later arrested by the Santa Barbara County police for refusing the order to move aside, according to a bystander at the event. 

By 9 a.m., the police had blocked off the entrance to the San Marcos Foothill Preserve parking lot claiming that there was “a crime scene.” However, other deputies stated that they were blocking the entrance to keep the protest peaceful. The blockage prevented many protesters from joining the event, which caused some of them to worry whether or not food and water could be brought uphill to the event to aid the protesters. Eventually, protestors found other entrance routes through footpaths.  

Many participants reported that they were unsure of what would come of the protest, as the bulldozers and construction workers stood by waiting for orders and police cars lined the parking lot. By 11 a.m., the advocacy group leaders and developers had come to an agreement to pause the construction for the day, partially due to the impressive turnout and community support displayed at the event, noted Sam Kita, a founder of the Save the San Marcos Foothills advocacy group. 

However, construction at the site has not been completely called off, with the possibility of protestors returning Friday and so forth. The event had gained traction and over 100 people were there to protest and show support. Lynch reinstated the importance of being at the event to pause the development. 

“We are just asking the developers and contractors to pause and give us more time. We are so close,” Lynch said. 

According to Lynch, the community is raising funds to buy the property from the developers. However, according to John Davies, PR consultant and political strategist for the Chadmar Group, $19 million is the cost of the property. So far, the advocacy group has fundraised just over three million.

One protestor at the event said they needed a few miracle donations to buy out the land, however other citizens remained optimistic that with time they’ll be able to buy the property. Despite the significant amount of money needed, community supporters reinforced the importance of preserving the last sacred Chumash land. Lynch also noted that it’s nesting season for many birds within the preserve, another reason as to why it’s important not to remove the grassland.  

“We will be here until the developers agree to pause construction,” shouted one protestor — a declaration that many other protesters shared. Until the money is raised, community members appear committed to showing up and sharing how important it is to them to preserve the land for the Chumash people, the ecosystem, and the community. 

As of Friday afternoon, there have been no other updates as to whether more protests will take place or if construction will be canceled as no official agreement has been made between the advocacy group and the developers. However, Save the San Marcos Foothills said that the primary objective now is to raise the required money to buy the land from the Chadmar Group. 

“We are still coming to an agreement about the cost of the land,” Lynch said. “But after Thursday’s protest, we are feeling really hopeful.” Real-time updates on the topic can be found on the Instagram page, @savethesanmarcosfoothills. More information on the development plans can be found on the Chadmar website.",2171
The Future of RAs,"Amidst the turmoil of the COVID-19 pandemic, UC Santa Barbara’s (UCSB) Residential & Community Living department has worked hard to adapt to the ever-changing working conditions of campus resident assistants (RA). The job, which closed its applications on Feb. 16, has a different look compared to years in the past.

There are currently 39 RAs living and working in UCSB’s residential housing, which includes graduate apartments, family student housing, and undergraduate apartments. According to Terrie Tran, the assistant director for Residential & Community Living, the RA job this year has been fully virtual, but RAs still serve the same general purpose as they did in previous years. 

“This position is important because it is one of the really highly coveted student leadership positions on campus,” Tran said in an interview with The Bottom Line. “Our RAs are truly the backbone of our residential program. They help us to carry out our mission of providing an inclusive, respectful, comfortable, and safe living environment for our residents on campus.”

Due to COVID-19, most of the RA applicants for the 2020-2021 school year were unable to fulfill the position. However, those who were originally offered the job were then allowed to defer the offer for a guaranteed RA position in the 2021-2022 school year. 

All new and deferred applicants have been notified of how the position may be affected by the unpredictability of the upcoming school year and the conditions of campus policy. Tran emphasized the importance of transparency with incoming RAs during these fast-changing times.

“The key is to stay agile and really be ready to pivot quickly, and at the same time, be as communicative and transparent with our candidates as possible,” Tran said. “Even if it’s an update saying that we don’t have anything to share right now, but we’re working on A, B, or C, and we’ll let you know by this date what we’ve found out. This is what we’ve committed to do for our candidates.”

“THE KEY IS TO STAY AGILE AND REALLY BE READY TO PIVOT QUICKLY, AND AT THE SAME TIME, BE AS COMMUNICATIVE AND TRANSPARENT WITH OUR CANDIDATES AS POSSIBLE.”

In past years, the RA selection process wrapped up by the end of March, and orientation occurred as early as spring quarter. However, according to Tran, RAs for the upcoming school year may not know their position until summer. While Tran understands that applicants may be looking for more certainty in the position, she does not expect a low number of applications to be submitted. 

“I think based on what we’re seeing with our applications, there is still a lot of interest. I think there’s still interest from students who want to serve and who also probably are hoping and wanting a residential community where they can be living and working with other students. So we’re not concerned about not having enough applicants in our pool,” Tran said.

Although RAs this year can’t interact face-to-face with their residents, safer virtual alternatives are being used to build a community for the residents. According to Tran, social media, the GroupMe app, weekly newsletters, Zoom events, and virtual office hours have allowed residents to interact amongst each other and with their RAs. 

While most of the RA positions operate remotely, some physical interaction is necessary to maintain safety within residence halls. Current in-person interactions come with safety precautions, such as wearing masks, social distancing, frequent hand washing, and workstation sanitizing. All offices are also using plexiglass safety guards for extra protection. 

With COVID-19 still in full force, it is hard to fully predict what next year’s RA position will entail, but Tran has maintained hope for the future.

“I really do think that based on what we’ve seen with our residential population right now, with weekly testing and vaccines coming up for the community, I really do think that it’s possible for us to reopen. For us to have a residential community again,” Tran said. “As long as everybody is compliant with testing and diligent with their own decisions and their own behaviors, it is doable.”",835
Pandemic Parties: Are Landlords Responsible?,"As COVID-19 continues to spread throughout Isla Vista, many students have continued hosting large gatherings and parties, ignoring county health ordinances. To the community’s dismay, party hosts have gone largely unpunished. 

In response, students have complained about the lack of accountability placed on neighbors who continue to host large gatherings while putting the community at risk. Complaints have been mainly directed towards law enforcement, UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) administrators, Isla Vista landlords, and leasing companies.

In an interview with The Bottom Line, Riley, a representative of the property management company Playa Life IV, explained the procedure for dealing with residents who have violated county health ordinances, along with legal limitations the company faces. 

The company collects information from law enforcement, the college the tenant may be enrolled in, and the tenant themselves in order to gather all sides of the story before issuing a warning letter to the property. 

“We provide them with a formal written notice that this is an issue that can’t continue. If it does continue, we’ll have to take further action,” stated Riley. 

According to the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department’s (SBCPHD) health officer order made effective in October of last year, large house parties fall under gatherings which incur fines of $100 for the first offense, $200 for the second offense, and $500 for any following offense within the same year.

However, Riley confirmed that landlords do not have the legal power to impose these fines on tenants throwing parties. Law enforcement officers and health representatives designated by the county are responsible for issuing citations and civil fines. 

Although the goal is to avoid evictions during the COVID-19 crisis, tenants may be subject to the eviction process if they pose a severe risk. While most residents usually comply after receiving warning notices, Playa Life IV has moved forward with one eviction during the pandemic. 

“However, Riley confirmed that landlords do not have the legal power to impose these fines on tenants throwing parties. Law enforcement officers and health representatives designated by the county are responsible for issuing citations and civil fines. “

“If we think it’s severe enough, if we deem it enough of a health risk, and if our attorneys can actually agree that we have a legal basis for eviction based on the actions of the tenants, then we will go through with that,” Riley explained. 

A residence that has reportedly faced eviction for several large parties is one of the units at the “Ganja Baby” house on Del Playa Drive, which is managed by Playa Life IV as well. A fourth-year student in a neighboring residence — who asked to remain anonymous — described the ways in which some tenants have deliberately disregarded the county health ordinance. 

“For their normal parties, I’d say around 30 to 50 people would go since there’d be a crowd in front of the house,” said the student. “The last gathering with the bouncy house had over 200 people on the balcony, from what I heard.”

Additionally, the party hosts can find ways to cover the county fines after being reported. 

“Cops wouldn’t do much other than warn them that they couldn’t party or else they’d get fined,” added the student. “Even if they did, they could just charge guests an entry fee to avoid it.”

UC Applications Reach All Time High,"On Jan. 28, the UC Pressroom stated that the University of California system received an all-time high of undergraduate applications for fall 2021 admission. A total of 249,855 applications were submitted, marking a 16.1 percent increase from last year. UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) represented an increase from 90,947 to 105,640 freshman applications received.

According to the University of California Office of the President Officials, all UC campuses highlighted an increase of freshman and transfer applications received from out-of-state international applicants.

UCSB’s California resident freshman applicants rose from 63,269 to 71,209, and international applicants increased from 16,690 to 17,602. Out-of-state applicants had the largest increase from 10,988 to 16,829, which is 53 percent more than the previous year. 

“I am heartened and inspired by so many hardworking students who want to attend the University of California,” said John A. Pérez, the UC Board of Regents chair. “The diverse backgrounds, many strengths, and impressive talents of those who enroll will undoubtedly enrich the UC community.”

Furthermore, freshman applications from African American students increased from 3,211 in fall 2020 to 3,820 for fall 2021, and applications from Chicanx/Latinx students jumped from 19,989 to 21,867.

“More applications mean that in order to stand out among the 105,623 applicants, a student needs to clearly demonstrate the positive qualities we are seeking,” Lisa Przekop, the director of the UCSB Office of Admissions, explained the data in an interview with The Bottom Line. “We read the applications very carefully to find those students who will strengthen UCSB inside and outside of the classroom.”

As mentioned in a recent letter from UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang: “We remain steadfast in our efforts to maintain and, indeed, to increase the diversity of our students, faculty, and staff.”

The UCSB admissions officers also believe in eliminating SAT/ACT exams from the application process and spending more time on school research when staying at home. 

“Using virtual tools, we were able to expand outreach efforts and ‘virtually’ visit more schools and attend more events than we have in the past,” Przekop said. 

Considering the widespread pandemic, UC Santa Barbara officials created more virtual opportunities for applicants to access campus tours, virtual open house events, and webinars. Through a simple registration process, students and their families can sign up for virtual campus tours led by current UCSB students who are ready to answer all questions. Students can also join other virtual presentations and student panels to gain further information without the possible danger of COVID-19 exposure. 

Zoom meetings, emails, and UCSB’s official Youtube channel have become other effective alternatives for students wanting to learn more about the university. Students can also chat with admissions counselors by signing up for Zoom advising appointments. Further information regarding UCSB academics and student life is also available on the “Explore UCSB” tab.

“USING VIRTUAL TOOLS, WE WERE ABLE TO EXPAND OUTREACH EFFORTS AND ‘VIRTUALLY’ VISIT MORE SCHOOLS AND ATTEND MORE EVENTS THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST,” PRZEKOP SAID. 

Due to the more competitive selection process, Przekop believes that the selection criteria is not only about excellent grades. “It is also about (showing) evidence that they are going to be active, engaged learners,” she said.

According to Przekop’s introduction, the UCSB admissions officers also look at whether applicants seek extra opportunities outside of the classroom to grow and learn, and whether they take advantage of educational opportunities such as honors courses. 

“We have also been tasked to look for those students who are going to make positive contributions to the UCSB community. For instance, will they lead our student organizations? Will they be role models to other students?” Przekop explained. 

Now, the UCSB admissions officers continuously revise their process to ensure every application, even when they’re dealing with more than 100,0000 applications, gets a personal, thorough review.  

“It is a challenge, given the tight time constraints but we’re confident we have developed a fair process,” Przekop said.",1797
Anti-Vaxxers in Santa Barbara County,"Santa Barbara citizens have started receiving their first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for the past month. However, some eligible candidates have refused the chance to receive the vaccine upon its distribution.

According to the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department, 63.5 percent of allocated vaccine doses have been administered in the county. The county has mainly distributed the vaccines to frontline health workers and citizens over 75, and plans to distribute them to childcare workers and people over 65 in the next phase of the vaccination rollout. 

A statement released by Santa Barbara county’s Public Health Department Director Van Do-Reynoso on Tuesday claims that 64 percent of residents aged 75 and up have been vaccinated — roughly 20,800 people based on population estimates. While this statistic is promising to some health officials, the herd immunity threshold has not been reached. According to Anthony Fauci, 90 percent of United States residents would have to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity.

However, polls conducted by Marina Pitovsky, a writer for The Hill, suggest that due to an unwilling fraction of the population, herd immunity may not even be a possibility in the near future. 

“Nearly one in three people in the United States said that they definitely or probably will not get the COVID-19 vaccine,” said Pitovsky in her article. 

Many are concerned about how quickly the vaccine has rolled out. Many say they want to “plan to wait and see if it is safe,” and that they may get it once it has been tested on more people. Though vaccine eligibility is opening up, a certain population has denied the validity of the vaccine despite having the opportunity to get it.

Zakiya Whatley and Titilayo Shodiya, writers for the Scientific American, cite that all social groups are reluctant to get the vaccine. It says that vaccine refusal is “most prevalent in wealthy, white areas,” but recent polls “indicate high levels of hesitancy and refusal among marginalized communities” as well. 

“NEARLY ONE IN THREE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES SAID THAT THEY DEFINITELY OR PROBABLY WILL NOT GET THE COVID-19 VACCINE.”

Whatley and Shodiya believe that before getting more of the population vaccinated, people need to recognize why anti-vaxxers resist immunization. They state that dismissing anti-vaxxers as “misinformed skeptics” can be dangerous because it stops people from considering why these people don’t believe in vaccination. 

Vaccine supporters typically attribute anti-vaxxer attitudes, or vaccine-educated attitudes, as the community prefers to call them, to a lack of access to vaccine use and effectiveness.

In a poll conducted by The Bottom Line, 52 students from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) stated that they plan to receive the vaccine while six said no. One student of the latter group said that they have medical issues that have been complicated with vaccinations in the past, and also do not support the vaccination due to religious beliefs.

“I’m allergic to certain medicines and it’s part of my belief,” said the anonymous second-year student at UCSB.

A few other students surveyed do plan to get the vaccine, but they only plan to receive it if the vaccine is necessary to resume in-person classes in the fall.

As for the COVID-19 vaccine, specifically, anti-vaxxers are apprehensive to receive the vaccine based on the reported death rates among patients following their first or second doses of the vaccine. However, a German fact-checking site called Deutsche Welle (DW) investigated claims of COVID-19 vaccine-related deaths in six different countries and ultimately attributed none of the deaths to the vaccine.

In all the studied cases, those who died were 79 to 93 years old and died between one hour and 19 days after receiving the vaccine. Of the 113 people, 20 died as a result of ongoing COVID-19 infections, which created complications compounded with the vaccine. Additionally, 43 people died as a result of pre-existing conditions, according to Brigitte Keller-Stanislawski, the head of the Paul Ehrlich Institute’s Division Safe­ty of Medic­i­nal Prod­ucts and Med­i­cal De­vices.

For some anti-vaxxers, the underlying medical conditions that make vaccines unfeasible are reason enough to refuse a vaccine. According to an article written by Delaney Smith of the Santa Barbara Independent in 2019, people in Santa Barbara county have resented the ways in which mass vaccination has been enforced by public health officials, even before COVID-19. An interviewee, who chose to go by the name Amanda, claims she was “very much for vaccines,” until she suffered critical side effects with the Gardasil human papillomavirus vaccine. Along with her body going into organ failure, she explains that she experienced temporary menopause for 10 years before being able to have children. 

Whether or not Amanda had any immunocompromising factors that may have made her exposure to the vaccine more dangerous, there is currently no medical evidence that proves a direct correlation between vaccination and other health problems.",1742
Will Housing Reopen in Fall 2021?,"After the University of California system announced its fall reopening plan, UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) Resident Assistant (RA) Selection Committee has opened RA applications. If COVID-19 causes further complications among students however, these positions can be rescinded.

“While we plan to reopen in fall at our normal (or slightly reduced capacity) … If at any time, our campus leadership decides that we cannot reopen our housing communities, we may need to rescind our offer of the position,” the committee stated in a RA Selection information video. 

UCSB students were glad to hear the news of dorm doors possibly opening on-campus residential housing for the fall quarter in 2021. 

Flora Lin, a third-year psychology and neuroscience major, explained her optimism about the potential residential reopening in the fall. 

“The UCSB University & Housing Communities has been actively updating housing information and provided chances to go back to UCSB,” she said.

Because of the limited supply of flight tickets back to China last March, she stayed in the limited campus housing provided during the spring quarter of 2020. 

“Decisions made by the housing committee have helped students like me …  who had to remain on campus because of all kinds of issues — like family issues and flight ticket shortages — to get through those challenging months,” said Flora. 

On March 13 last year, UCSB University & Community Housing Services gave students three housing options for the spring quarter of 2020: living in the Santa Catalina residence hall, living off from campus during April, or cancelling residence contracts altogether. 

After Chancellor Henry Yang released an updated letter addressing the statewide stay-at-home order on March 19, the housing committee ordered all remaining undergraduates living in residence halls to relocate to the Santa Catalina dorms, a building that “provided ample space to house all residence hall students in a way that maintains appropriate social distancing,” said in Chancellor Yang’s letter. 

Almost nine months later in December, UCSB Housing, Dining & Auxiliary Enterprises decided to allocate space during the winter quarter for residents in the San Joaquin, Sierra Madre, and Santa Ynez undergraduate apartments. Those who signed housing contracts that went unfulfilled in the fall had major priority.  

According to Jill Hurd, the director of UCSB Residential & Community Living, these students were allowed to move into the undergraduate apartments between Jan. 15 and Jan. 18. 

All students currently residing there are required to follow medical precaution guidelines before and after entering the new spaces. These medical precautions include wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, and “the Student Health daily COVID-19 symptom screening survey” that was due 10 days before arrival. 

The California Department of Public Health recently issued updated health guidance and lifted the regional stay-at-home order because of increasing intensive care unit capacity. As Santa Barbara county moved into the purple tier, which indicates the high spread of COVID-19 cases in the county, campus officials responded in cooperation with the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department and the UC Office of The President to reduce COVID-19 infections.",1384
Students Allege Poor Working Conditions at UCSB’s Annual Fund,"From donating estates to academic departments to establishing research programs for students and faculty, UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) alumni and families have gifted donations that are valuable to current and future students, staff, and faculty.

Many of these improvements are made possible by UCSB’s Annual Fund through the Office of Development, which collects donations to a general fund for the campus, needs or allows donors to choose a specific cause. 

“These annual unrestricted gifts sustain every part of the UCSB experience including students’ well-being, instruction, research, and innovation,” the Office of Development website reads. “The Annual Fund also supports classrooms and labs, tutoring, the arts, and the breathtaking campus that we call home.”

While donations are essential to maintaining the campus and funding programs, several student workers at the Annual Fund have complained about the high-pressure and uncomfortable working conditions. Employees have taken their complaints to social media, posting in Reddit threads spanning from nine years ago to just over a week ago.

The most recent Reddit post, which labels the Annual Fund as a “cult” details how the Annual Fund exploits students in need of on-campus employment. The organization is also accused of exploiting alumni before they’ve had the chance to find success with their degree through the Senior Class Gift, which “is an opportunity for graduating Gauchos to identify an area on campus to leave a lasting legacy.”

A fourth-year economics major, who asked to remain anonymous, detailed their experience working as a student caller for the Annual Fund over the summer of 2018 in an interview with The Bottom Line. 

“The senior class gift we had was a donation to the sexual assault survivor fund so a lot of students we called felt like we were guilt-tripping them or holding sexual assault over them,” said the student. 

“I also felt really bad while on the phone with older parents or people who didn’t speak English too well,” the student continued. “I sort of felt like I was swindling them and setting a precedent for them to give credit card information over the phone, which under regular circumstances I hope they never do.”

“WHILE DONATIONS ARE ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAINING THE CAMPUS AND FUNDING PROGRAMS, SEVERAL STUDENT WORKERS AT THE ANNUAL FUND HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE HIGH-PRESSURE AND UNCOMFORTABLE WORKING CONDITIONS.”

While most on-campus jobs for students are based on hourly pay, the Annual Fund is reportedly one of the few organizations at UCSB that pays student employees based on performance-based rates, which are calculated based on the amount of credit card donations solicited from donors. 

Although monthly donation pledge cards are an option, the anonymous student recounted that there is more pressure placed on workers to secure a donation through a credit card payment because “it’s money on the spot.” 

Performance-based pay usually results in a number of top-performing employees coming out on top, while other employees feel the pressure to catch up. Many research studies have shown that this type of compensation may make employees work harder, but it can also lead to high stress and low job satisfaction. 

However, the anonymous former student employee for the Annual Fund was not reprimanded by supervisors, despite not performing well in the workplace: “The student managers I had were really nice.”

“It’s the job that the university asks us to do that’s honestly terrible,” the student added.

Another major factor that puts further strain on student callers is that many recent UCSB graduates are not able to contribute to the Senior Class Gift due to owing thousands of dollars in student loans. Since there is only a six-month grace period for payments following graduation, this gives alumni little time to pay off a reasonable amount of their balances before considering a donation. 

The U.S. News College Compass page for UCSB indicates that the average student loan debt for graduating students in 2019 was $18,995, with 51 percent of students in the 2019 graduating class borrowing any type of loan. 

Additionally, the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard indicates that the typical 10-year payment plan for student loans at UCSB ranges from $124 to $210 per month. 

UCSB’s Annual Fund did not reply to requests for comment.",2586
Students’ Problems With Student Health,"As the UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) Student Health clinic expands its services to accommodate the COVID-19 pandemic, many UCSB students are speaking out against the clinic’s poor care quality via social media. Although many report positive experiences with Student Health, a growing number are voicing complaints about Student Health staff, describing rude or dismissive interactions when being examined.

Megan, a fourth-year international student, is one of many to come forward with her experience, describing a “rude and awful” encounter with an optometrist she saw through Student Health.

“[The optometrist] made me walk out of an eye exam without sunglasses or any [type] of protection,” Megan recalled. Despite bringing up her issues with light sensitivity and pain, Megan said that the optometrist laughed at her and dismissed her concerns. 

“I had never done an eye exam before. We don’t do them where I am from,” said Megan. “[She] treated me like I was very dumb.”

Megan was vocal about her concerns on social media, posting about her appointment in a discussion thread on the UC Santa Barbara Reddit page. She was joined by other users who identified the optometrist as Dr. Heather Nichols, and reported similar experiences under Nichols’ care. One user described her as “extremely unprofessional,” encouraging students to file a complaint for Nichol’s dismissal.

The Bottom Line (TBL) interviewed an anonymous graduate student who also had a negative experience with Nichols, claiming that his interaction with her “left a bad taste in [his] mouth.” 

After contracting pink eye in 2018, the graduate student saw Nichols when he went to Student Health for an examination. Nichols told the student that the irritation in his eye was caused by allergies. When the student asked Nichols if she was sure about her diagnosis, he recalled her “snapping back” at him.

“I couldn’t figure it out,” he said. “She took my tone as questioning her authority […] and I didn’t want to mess with that. I’ve been in situations like that before. I know that kind of personality.”

The encounter made the student wary of going to Student Health at all, similar to many other Reddit posters who sought Nichols’ care. Over two years after the incident occurred, the graduate student finally shared his experience after seeing one of the discussion threads made about Nichols.

“IT’S WHY I DISLIKE US HEALTHCARE,” THE STUDENT SAID IN AN INTERVIEW. “GROWING UP, I ALWAYS HAD A DISTRUST OF THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY, ESPECIALLY BEING A WOMAN OF COLOR.”

“I felt a little vindicated,” he said. “I realized it wasn’t just me, and I felt better about myself.”

The stirrings about Nichols on social media sparked three discussion threads on Reddit during the month of January alone. One thread speculates of Nichols’ removal from Student Health in mid-January, noting that Nichols is no longer listed under the medical staff on the Student Health website.

In an email sent to TBL, Student Health confirmed Nichols’ departure, although they did not disclose if Nichols resigned or was let go from her position. According to Eye Clinic Supervisor Ruth Solis, Nichols was no longer available for appointments as of early February. As of Feb. 7, the Student Health website also shows that the optometrist position is currently vacant.

In the email, Solis added that there is currently no one who can perform an eye exam at the clinic. Students interested in an eye examination will have to make appointments with other optometry groups in Goleta and Santa Barbara, which could result in out-of-pocket fees for many.

Despite the inconvenience, the graduate student who spoke to TBL approves of Nichols’ departure. “It [was] horrible bedside manner,” he said. “As a healthcare provider, you don’t do that. You provide a voice of calm. That’s what you do as a doctor.”

Other students on Reddit chimed in, noting that Student Health’s optometry clinic isn’t the only problem.

One anonymous third-year student told TBL about a negative experience with a hand specialist she saw at Student Health, although the student did not disclose the name of the doctor she saw.

After getting into a bike accident and splintering her finger in early 2020, the student sought treatment in Urgent Care. After two subsequent appointments, she was prescribed antibiotics and referred to the hand specialist for treatment. 

Despite her finger being “so swollen” she could barely bend it, she says the specialist told her that there was “nothing wrong.” He continued to ignore her concerns, even when she repeatedly said she believed there was something lodged in her hand.

“He was really dismissive,” she said, recalling that the specialist used a “really aggressive tone.” 

“I told him I felt like something was stuck in [my finger],” the student added. “[The doctor] said I just had to keep moving it and he just grabbed my finger and forced it down,” leading her to scream in pain. 

“I couldn’t even bend it halfway on my own,” she said. “It just hurt a lot.” 

Frustrated with her experience, the student resorted to removing the splinter by herself. At the time of removal, it had been in her hand for nearly a month.

“It’s why I dislike U.S. healthcare,” the student said in an interview with TBL. “Growing up, I always had a distrust of the healthcare industry, especially being a woman of color.”

The student pointed to the discrimination against women and people of color when receiving treatment, which has been well-documented in the scientific literature. One study published in 2012 suggests that African-American patients who reported pain were over 20 percent less likely to receive medication for it than white patients. A 2008 study showed that, on average, women waited 16 minutes longer than men in the emergency room, despite reporting the same set symptoms.

“[My experience at Student Health] kind of confirmed it for me, that [doctors] didn’t really care about my concerns,” the student said.

Reddit users have pointed out inconsistency within the UCSB Student Health clinic, with patient experiences ranging from excellent to painful. Although Megan, for instance, described her appointment with Nichols as “awful,” she also noted that every other staff member she has seen through Student Health was “marvelous” in their care.

“I’ve gone to Student Health a bunch of times and I have always had a pretty good experience there!” added Serena, a fourth-year undergraduate student. “I much prefer coming to [Student Health],” she said, due to the fact that many of the clinicians are “attentive” and “easy to talk to.” 

“EXPERTS HAVE POSITED THAT COMPASSION FATIGUE IS A GROWING PROBLEM WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY — PARTICULARLY SO DURING COVID-19, WITH WIDESPREAD ILLNESS EXHAUSTING THE EMPATHY OF MANY HEALTHCARE WORKERS.”

“I feel like [many of the doctors] are very used to dealing with college student concerns, so […] I don’t feel as embarrassed asking certain questions,” Serena said. Although, she also admitted that her experience largely depended on the doctor she saw during her appointments. When she contracted strep throat, she recalls seeing a doctor who dismissed her concerns that it “was something [more] serious.”

“Most of the other staff that I see usually at least try to reassure me to calm down and are more polite,” Serena said — adding that she was a “bit of a hypochondriac.” “I just wished [the doctor] was a bit more empathetic about it.”

Andrea, a fourth-year undergraduate, agreed that her experience at Student Health largely depended on who she saw. She told TBL of “insanely rude” encounters by staff when getting lab work done, although she adds that her experiences with other doctors and nurses have been great.

“It makes me not want to go at all,” she said, describing the curtness of the staff when getting her blood drawn. “They don’t even warn you when they’re about to stick the needle in.”

Some think that the inconsistency within Student Health illustrates the larger issue of compassion fatigue, a phenomenon where those who are regularly exposed to others’ suffering, like healthcare workers, gradually lose their ability to feel empathy for others. Experts have posited that compassion fatigue is a growing problem within the healthcare industry — particularly so during COVID-19, with widespread illness exhausting the empathy of many healthcare workers.

Licensed family and marriage therapist Sherisa Dahlgren partnered with UCSB Counseling and Psychological Services to host an event about compassion fatigue on Monday, discussing its ramifications and strategies to prevent it when caring for patients.

“Individuals who work in helping professions often do so out of a deep commitment to making the world a safer, more joyful place for others,” said Dahlgren. “Yet, this often comes at a personal and professional price when high levels of exposures [sic] to the suffering of others becomes our normal, day-to-day experience.”

Several students, when asked if there were any improvements that could be made at Student Health, were quick to brainstorm ideas. 

The graduate student, who spoke to TBL, said it would have been helpful for the clinic to have an official system to hear patient comments, which would allow students to report negative experiences and clearly identify areas of improvement. 

“I understand that you can get flooded with comments or grievances about staff,” the student said. “But the challenge is to have better communication with the public.”

The anonymous third-year student added that she believed many negative experiences in the clinic could be lessened with better training, particularly multicultural training. 

“There’s a long history of women and women of color being dismissed in healthcare,” she said. “Just watching a video is not going to help people be more compassionate.” ",2511
UCSB Receives $38 Million in Upcoming Stimulus Check,"According to the United States Department of Education’s website, UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) will receive approximately $38 million in their upcoming stimulus check. This stimulus check comes from the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSA Act) signed on Dec. 27, 2020.

The CRRSA Act designated a total of $21.2 billion in COVID-19 relief funds towards colleges and universities this year. This stimulus package will incentivize students to continue their educational endeavors through the current pandemic.

The fund authorized by this act is known as the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund II (HEERF II), and it follows the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) that the U.S. Department of Education passed last March. 

This new stimulus check under the HEERF II fund directs even more money towards higher education institutions than the previous bill, granting colleges and universities $21.2 billion as opposed to the $14 billion received in the CARES Act.

The most notable distinctions between the CARES Act and the CRRSA Act are who qualifies for HEERF II grants, the procedures to apply, and which university enterprises will receive the grants. In the CARES Act, for instance, only certain institutions of higher education defined vaguely as extension programs and continuing education, qualified for grant money. In the CRRSA Act, those institutions of higher education that fall specifically under public, private nonprofit, or proprietary designations qualify for the grant money,

“This new stimulus check under the HEERF II fund directs even more money towards higher education institutions than the previous bill, granting colleges and universities $21.2 billion as opposed to the $14 billion received in the CARES Act.”

Public institutions will receive about 97 percent of the stimulus check funds, whereas private schools will receive the remainder. While public institutions, including UCSB, have been given flexibility in how they choose to distribute their stimulus checks, private colleges must devote their stimulus funds exclusively towards student financial aid.

Last year, UCSB sent CARES Grant funds, ranging from $650 to $1,700, to eligible students. Students this year are anticipating a raise in their grant amounts in conjunction with the raise of money allocated to higher education institutions in the new stimulus bill.

The Office of Financial Aid confirmed that UCSB will divert part of the funding directly towards student aid, but the range of grant amounts that students may receive remains unknown. 

“In regards to the additional funding, we are excited and relieved to know that additional resources are on their way,” clarified the Office of Financial Aid in an interview with The Bottom Line. “We’ll work diligently to get funding out to eligible students once it becomes available. Our website will be updated once additional information is provided to us by the Department of Education.”

The U.S. Department of Education’s website explains its criteria for each university’s monetary allocation. The $38 million that UCSB will receive this winter comes from a formula based on the “relative share of Federal Pell Grant recipients, the relative shares of non-Pell Grant recipients, and the relative shares of Federal Pell and non-Pell Grant recipients exclusively enrolled in distance education prior to the coronavirus emergency.” 

“The Office of Financial Aid confirmed that UCSB will divert part of the funding directly towards student aid, but the range of grant amounts that students may receive remains unknown.”

Though little information on the relief money has been released to UCSB students and faculty, some schools in California have received further details on their stimulus packages. Two weeks ago, the UC Riverside (UCR) Chancellor Kim A. Wilcox sent an email to the student body about the stimulus package for the 2021 school year.

“UC Riverside is projected to receive approximately $45.4 million in one-time funding with a minimum of $14.8 million of these funds earmarked for student financial aid, via the most recent CARES Act signed into law in December,” explained Wilcox in the email. 

UCSB received $25.2 million last year while $12.6 million went to financial aid, so students may anticipate a similar increase as UCR.

The Office of Financial Aid intends to publish all information regarding the stimulus check on their website once they receive the funds. In the meantime, they advise students to file their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) forms and periodically check for any updates in the following few weeks.",1621
UCSB’s Cheating Epidemic,"Since the transition from in-person classes to online classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more students have turned to online cheating to help them understand difficult course material. Recently, the UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) Office of Student Conduct (OSC) reported a concerning upward trend in violations of academic integrity, which was revealed in a campus-wide email.

“When stressed, in crisis, or feeling desperate, our ability to make informed decisions is also compromised,” read the email from the OSC. “However, it is important that we maintain the value of the degree that you are working so hard to attain and that requires that everyone be held to our standards of academic conduct.”

UCSB students implicated in academic misconduct will be contacted via email, which will notify them if they are obligated to schedule a meeting with the OSC. If the email does not specify a meeting, the report is considered a warning and no further action will be required on the student’s behalf.

The email will also inform students if they have been formally charged with a Student Conduct Code violation and must accept the penalties or request a hearing. Those who are not formally charged may still be held liable for completing certain requirements.

Many UCSB students have turned to outside resources due to the stress of learning at home during the pandemic, and the inability to access campus resources or interact with professors in-person. 

“It’s easy to panic when we don’t have the same learning environment as before,” said an anonymous fourth-year biology major in an interview with The Bottom Line. “I used to rely on having the library as a quiet place to focus, and not all professors understand that living at home can be super distracting to our studying.” 

“The fact that so many UCSB students have turned to cheating all of a sudden during a really difficult time should actually make people question the way our classes have been formatted,” the student continued. 

“MANY UCSB STUDENTS HAVE TURNED TO OUTSIDE RESOURCES DUE TO THE STRESS OF LEARNING AT HOME DURING THE PANDEMIC, AND THE INABILITY TO ACCESS CAMPUS RESOURCES OR INTERACT WITH PROFESSORS IN-PERSON.”

A majority of these referrals for academic dishonesty regard students who collaborate in groups without permission, as well as the use of tutoring sites such as Chegg. As stated in the campus-wide email, accessing course materials outside of the classroom also infringes on the university’s copyright policy.

According to its honor code, Chegg may share user information and activity with educational institutions if they suspect cheating or fraud. The site also has an honor shield that instructors may use to upload their exams and prevent students from accessing content during the time window of the exam. 

“Even with hours of studying and taking notes, the exams are timed and that puts a lot of pressure to just look up some of the blank questions on Chegg just to avoid failing the class,” added the anonymous fourth-year student.

Another popular way of cheating is through the messaging app GroupMe, which has been used for a variety of UCSB courses. 

An anonymous third-year sociology major explained that many students use the app to collaborate with other classmates: “One of my classes had really hard quizzes, and we would just ask for the answer to a question in the group chat when we reach the last attempt and get desperate.”

“It was also easier to make friends and create study groups before the pandemic, and it’s even harder for transfer students and freshmen now,” the student added.

Another concern for many students is major departments refusing to provide a pass/no pass grading option, which is also a source of academic stress. According to the third-year student, the sociology department chose to “stand by professors” and continues to require its students to take courses for a letter grade. 

Although accessing outside resources is tempting during such a challenging time for learning, the Office of Student Conduct encourages students who are struggling academically to reach out to the variety of campus resources available at UCSB. ",1756
Undergraduate Research during COVID-19,"According to U.S. News and World Report, UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) hosts around a dozen national research institutes on its campus. A majority of the research projects conducted by these institutes have had to adapt to the unique demands of the pandemic and remote operation to carry on with their work. 

Of course, the research process for all departments varies. Some researchers spend hours in the lab reviewing bacteria samples under a microscope, others travel hundreds of miles to explore ancient ruins abroad. While the research process itself is not universal, many research techniques already have been or can be converted into an online format.

UCSB’s Office of Research has drafted a six-step plan to gradually phase in-person research back on campus. As of Jan. 4, we have been in the fourth stage of this progression, and 25 percent of on-site research has been restored with about 750 employees working on campus. Departments that use field research methods, which include several departments in both the humanities and social sciences, have recently been able to resume their work as local California sites have been granted permission for observation by academic research committees. 

However, according to the six-step plan, not all undergraduate research assistants will fully return to campus in the current stage of the ramp-up. With the exception of a few undergraduate research assistants that have essential roles in critical research projects, most undergraduate researchers will be allowed back on campus little by little through the fourth, fifth, and sixth stages. 

“Undergraduates are included in Stages 1, 2, or 3 of the ramp-up in the very rare cases in which they are irreplaceable for essential maintenance,” stated the UCSB Office of Research on their website. “We will consider proposals for small numbers of undergraduates to begin research in Stage 4, such as those with summer fellowships (e.g. CCS, Worster, etc.).”

For the time being, undergraduate research assistants have primarily conducted their work remotely. Most undergraduate students seeking research opportunities right now have turned to the Faculty Research Assistance Program directory to work on projects from home. This directory keeps students updated with ongoing projects, some of which have offered remote research opportunities for students looking to get newly involved.

One professor, Alex Lukas, a new hire at UCSB’s art department, has not been halted by the pandemic and is continuing his work on a ten-year research project aimed at developing the ‘Zine Cataloging project. This initiative aims to make ‘zines, a tactile and mass-produced art medium that captures both fictional and real narratives, accessible for a wider audience via the internet. 

According to Lukas, the COVID-19 pandemic has made the goal of this project an “object of necessity,” as online communication has become one of the only mediums through which everyone can stay connected. Lukas’s team consists of three undergraduate art majors, which he encourages to be creative and pushes them to delve into their own thematic interests to help with the advancement of the project.

“With the pandemic, the ability to handle a ‘zine project is difficult,” explained Lukas in an interview with The Bottom Line. “But there is a silver lining in thinking about how we can best disseminate this material for a wider audience,” he continued.

Dr. Linda Adler-Kassner, a research lead for UCSB’s Center for Innovative Teaching, Research, and Learning (CITRAL), is also operating remotely and is currently pioneering a project studying how learning and teaching experiences have changed with COVID-19. Specifically, the study looks at how both physical and mental “placement” affects the academic experience. Because COVID-19 has disrupted the physical and mental security of many students, the study begs to ask how placement influences learning when placement itself is not entirely certain. 

Dr. Adler-Kassner says that though COVID-19 has introduced a number of challenges for research in terms of execution and communication, it has also created new opportunities. The outcomes of COVID-19 reflect a larger evolution in society that scientists are eager to study.

“If there’s anything that COVID-19 gives us, it’s the opportunity to ask lots of questions,” explained Adler-Kassner when conversing with The Bottom Line. “The implications of what we’re learning about right now will contribute to the things we do even when we’re back on campus,” she added.

For other research initiatives, COVID-19 has given the opportunity to sample new demographics that may have been harder to reach pre-pandemic. Dr. Erika Felix’s, of the psychology and brain sciences department, current project on Gen-Z Youth’s Responses to the pandemic has now been able to survey students from Puerto Rico, providing an even wider range of data to analyze. The current remote avenues of COVID-19 have also given a new sense of legitimacy to online research, as all business right now can only be conducted online.

“Now that [online research] has become more established, I think it will become the new standard,” Dr. Felix explained to The Bottom Line. “Researchers won’t look down on it anymore because they’ve all been in the same boat.”

With the demand of students wanting to enter graduate school and the modern workforce requiring more practical experience under the belt, the interest in research opportunities among graduates is not fading away any time soon. However, during quarantine and remote instruction, COVID-19 has reduced the access to research opportunities that undergraduate students typically enjoy during the school year.

For students trying to gain research experience during the pandemic, Adler-Kassner, Lukas, and Felix encourage students to apply broadly with a strong sense of both enthusiasm and flexibility. As students can help with things like literature reviews, summaries, and project assembly, the possibilities for undergraduates to join research initiatives still exist in these troubling times.

UC Forecasts Campus Reopening in Fall 2021,"As plans to distribute the COVID-19 vaccination gradually develop, the University of California (UC) recently announced its plan to bring students back to its 10 campuses in the fall of 2021.

While the well-being of students is being prioritized, UC President Michael V. Drake finalized the decision on Jan. 11, showing optimism when consulting with the 10 UC chancellors. 

“Current forecasts give us hope that in the fall, our students can enjoy a more normal on-campus experience,” he said. 

In June of last year, UC Santa Barbara’s (UCSB) Office of the Chancellor stated it would permit students back on campus in the fall of 2020 if the Santa Barbara county and California state guidelines authorized in-person instruction. According to UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang, the university was prepared to host on-campus classes limited to research if conditions permitted. However, due to the slowly growing infection rates in Santa Barbara county, the majority of classes and research opportunities remained virtual in fall and winter quarters. 

Although Drake has expressed his “hope that in the fall students can enjoy a more normal on-campus experience,” the UC system has also noted it will adapt to the situation as it evolves, primarily by establishing a COVID-19 working group and a pandemic response team.

“UC President Michael V. Drake finalized the decision on Jan. 11, showing optimism when consulting with the 10 UC chancellors.”

The state of fall quarter instruction will also depend on vaccine distribution, which is under the jurisdiction of the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (SBCPHD). According to a press release from the SBCPHD, public health officials are currently giving priority to frontline workers and people aged 75 and older due to the current vaccine limitations in Santa Barbara county. 

“About 81 percent of vaccines are allocated to our community providers, including clinics, hospitals … These entities are offering vaccine opportunities for the eligibles … The case rate has decreased by 20 percent, this is really encouraging news,” the department stated in a press conference. 

UC Santa Barbara students, faculty, and staff are encouraged to consult with their health care providers regarding their eligibility to receive the vaccine and to obtain additional information from the California Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“The state of fall quarter instruction will also depend on vaccine distribution, which is under the jurisdiction of the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (SBCPHD).”

The issue of reopening and future vaccine eligibility has raised both support and concerns among the student body. 

Yiting, a sophomore majoring in mathematics, expressed her opposition to the potential of in-person instruction in fall. 

“The pandemic seems endless to me. Things may not be better in September and the remote instruction is more flexible and safer for every student, either domestic students or international students,” she said. 

Natalie Chen, a second-year majoring in environmental studies, has been conducting her studies remotely in China since the pandemic and she desires in-person lectures and sections. 

“I support the school reopening in fall if the pandemic becomes more under control and the effectiveness of vaccines has been examined on a larger scale,” she explained.

UCSB Student Health has not responded or commented on plans to distribute the vaccines or safety protocols if the university reopens during the fall.",1238
Are Tiny Homes Helping Homeless People?,"COVID-19 has increased homelessness in many areas across the country, including Isla Vista. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) created guidelines on how to manage the spread of COVID-19 among areas where homelessness was more prevalent. 

In Isla Vista (I.V.), many of the homeless reside in the public parks of Anisq’Oyo Park, Camino Corto Open Space, and Sueno Orchard. The number of homeless people staying at these parks also increased during the pandemic, which led Governor Gavin Newsom to implement the COVID-19 Encampment Management Policy. 

The policy, which has been put into effect by the Isla Vista Recreation & Park District (IVRPD) along with community partners and stakeholders, proposes using tiny homes as temporary shelters for the homeless in Isla Vista. 

The Isla Vista Community Center (IVCC) worked with the social purpose company Pallet to build tiny homes, located in the parking lot of the IVCC. These shelters are 64 square feet and meant to be a “transition into permanent housing, at a fraction of the cost of traditional shelter alternatives.” 

“THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE STAYING AT [THESE] PARKS ALSO INCREASED DURING THE PANDEMIC, WHICH LED GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM TO IMPLEMENT THE COVID-19 ENCAMPMENT MANAGEMENT POLICY.”

The shelters were built in December 2020 and were filled by houseless community members shortly after. Through the IVRPD, the homeless were relocated from tents and other forms of temporary housing in Isla Vista’s public parks — there are 20 tiny trailer homes in total. 

The transition has faced some backlash from Isla Vista community members. The organization, Food Not Bombs Isla Vista, which is dedicated to providing free meals for the underprivileged throughout the community, posted a photo on Instagram in December regarding the relocation efforts, calling them “the direct result of coercion through [sic] the threat of assault [sic], arrest, and imprisonment.”

The account goes on in other posts to argue that the houseless population of I.V. is still a part of the community, condemning public comments that praise the IVCC and other organizations for evicting the houseless from public parks.

The IVRPD’s COVID-19 Encampment Report states that the “IVRPD is sympathetic to the disproportionate impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on individuals experiencing homelessness.” IVRPD displayed their sympathy by suspending some of their policies that keep public parks open to the public — rather than act as shelters — such as suspending encampment and dumping of property on the public parks. If implemented, these new policies would have resulted in disciplinary action for the houseless.

Food Not Bombs Isla Vista has argued that the actions of the IVRPD, nonetheless, are “out of line” given the severity of the pandemic and the lack of respect among the community for the houseless in general: “DO NOT interpret this move as something [the houseless] preferred, as it is the direct result of coercion through the threat of assault, arrest, and imprisonment.”",997
California Lifts Stay-at-Home Order,"Governor Gavin Newsom and the California Department of Public Health announced on Monday that the statewide stay-at-home order has been lifted, which means that restaurants and businesses are allowed to function according to social distancing guidelines in many counties. 

After pulling an “emergency brake” last November due to an alarming rise in COVID-19 cases, Newsom officially lifted the order this week, as hospitalization rates appear to be improving. Despite the surge of infections during the holidays, the projected state intensive care unit availability is currently above 15 percent. 

Because most counties in California will now be classified under the color-coded tier system, Santa Barbara county will remain operating under purple tier rules, which means that most indoor operations will have to remain closed. This includes restaurants, gyms and other activities and services. Outdoor restaurant dining, as well as hair and nail salons, will likely be allowed to reopen with restrictions. 

In order to exit the purple tier, the county will need to report a daily adjusted new case rate of no more than seven. 

The California Department of Public Health still encourages people to continue wearing masks to protect themselves and others, staying at least six feet away from others, avoiding crowds, and only leaving for essential services and necessities.",654
UCSB’s Vaccine Plan,"On Jan. 11, University of California (UC) President Michael Drake announced that all 10 UC campuses are working towards safely reinstating in-person instruction for the upcoming fall quarter. Each UC campus plans to announce their individual safety precautions as they continue to consult public health authorities in their respective regions. 

Following this news, a campus-wide email was sent out by the vice-chancellor for administration on Friday detailing how UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) proposes to move forward with vaccinating its students, faculty, and staff to meet the goal of reopening campus.

After receiving approval from the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department, the university completed Phase 1A for all healthcare workers at risk of exposure to the virus in the campus community. 

UCSB has currently received further approval to begin Phase 1B next week consisting of “active staff and faculty over the age of 75” who have been contacted by Student Health (SHS) over email for eligibility. Any excess doses will then be administered to staff and faculty between the ages of 65 to 75 years old. 

“After receiving approval from the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department, the university completed Phase 1A for all healthcare workers at risk of exposure to the virus in the campus community.”

“At this time, we still do not have additional information about how other members of our UC Santa Barbara community will be able to access the vaccine or if additional vaccines will be made available to campus,” reads the campus-wide email. 

This aligns with California’s projected Phase 1B COVID-19 vaccination plan, which also includes workers in the sectors of education and childcare, emergency services, and food and agriculture. The second part of this phase will cover workers in other sectors such as transportation, as well as the incarcerated and homeless populations. 
According to the website, 1,454,626 doses of the vaccine have been administered as of Jan. 19. Most Californians are also expected to receive the vaccine by the start of the summer of 2021. 

While students wait a return to normal campus life, it’s still essential to practice social distancing, wear masks, and follow public health guidelines until the vaccine reaches the general population. Even after the last dose of the vaccine, it takes a few weeks for an individual to be protected from becoming infected with the virus and potentially spreading it to others. 

A separate campus-wide email from Margaret Klawunn, the vice chancellor for Student Affairs, and Vejas Skripkus, executive director of Student Health, announced an alarming increase of 73 positive test results received over the past weekend unrelated to the recent move-ins for on-campus housing. 

“Recent reports indicate Santa Barbara as the California county hardest hit by COVID-19 during its third wave.”

Additionally, the email announced that Student Health is reporting over twice as many positive results during the previous week of this quarter than in the final week of fall quarter. This urge to follow the precautions of the Regional Stay-At-Home Order also comes as recent reports indicate Santa Barbara as the California county hardest hit by COVID-19 during its third wave.

Data collected by the state in a graph for Santa Barbara county displays an R-effective of greater than one at the start of January — an epidemiological measure that indicates how many secondary cases will result from an infected individual. A value of one indicates a constant number of cases while a value greater than one indicates a dramatic increase in cases.

Free COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic testing is available on campus for UCSB students Monday through Friday through the Student Health portal. More information on community testing and vaccinations may be found on Santa Barbara County Public Health website. ",1567
AS Presidential Elections Are Now Live!,"The UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) Associated Students (AS) Winter Special Election is currently live. All UCSB undergraduate students can cast their votes online until Thursday, Jan. 14 at 4 p.m. 

In order for the election to be valid, a four percent voter turnout is required. As of Wednesday, there are 1,551 undergraduate students that voted online, which currently puts the voter turnout to 6.84 percent. 

The Associated Students Election Board opened applications for the position of Associated Student President in November 2020, after former elected AS President Daevionne Beasley resigned from his position back in October. Since his resignation, Internal Vice President Tianna White stepped up and is serving as the interim AS president until elections are complete. 

There are currently two candidates for the president position: Carlos “Andy” Ruiz and Lea Toubian. Both candidates are running as Independent. Carlos “Andy” Ruiz is a fourth-year sociology major, pursuing a double-minor in feminist studies and education. Lea Toubian is a fourth year, pursuing a double major in political science and environmental studies.

More information regarding the candidates can be found on elections.as.ucsb.edu and the ballot can be found in vote.as.ucsb.edu. ",1177
UCSB Student Proposes a Campus Zip Line,"From kayaking to rock climbing, and now perhaps even zip lining, students at the University of California have been able to participate in a variety of recreational activities on campus.

Recently, UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) student Dylan Ruebenstahl posted a proposal for a zip line on the Facebook group, Free & For Sale (UCSB), after discovering that the second story of the Art Department building would be a fitting starting point. The proposed zip line would extend all the way to the campus lagoon.

Ruebenstahl, a fourth-year film and media studies major, sat down for an interview with The Bottom Line to further explain why UCSB would benefit from installing a zip line on campus. 

While he has not yet reached out to any departments or administrators on campus, Ruebenstahl has assembled interested students of varying academic backgrounds and recreational experiences, calling them “the ultimate zip line dream team.”

Ruebenstahl has had some difficulty being taken seriously for the project and received many Facebook comments talking poorly of his proposal, but many people have also messaged him to reach out about his vision for the zip line.

“Some have been really helpful and others have just been plain rude,” he said. 

A zip line on a university campus is not a brand new idea. Syracuse University’s Department of Recreation Services has a dual zip line open to the public as part of its Challenge Course, which has been used for personal development and team-building activities.

According to Ruebenstahl’s proposal, the expenses of building the zip line are less than 0.01 percent of the revenue UCSB receives from in-state student tuition, meaning it would be a particularly small investment for the school. International and out-of-state students also continue to pay full tuition for online classes. 

At most, he estimates that the cost would be $8,000 based on the Tree Top Builders Inc. website, which is a construction company specializing in treehouses and other custom made structures attached to trees. The company’s starting price for a zip line is $2,000. 

“Seeing that we are paying full tuition for online school, with so many facilities going unused and that UCSB doesn’t have to power, it would be crazy to think we couldn’t get $8,000 for a zip line,” said Ruebenstahl. 

In terms of safety, Ruebenstahl claims in his proposal that he is familiar with the procedures and risks after having several experiences on a zip line. Tree Top Builders Inc. recommends the use of safety equipment such as helmets and harnesses. 

While zip lines are not federally regulated in the United States, California’s Division of Occupational Health and Safety sets guidelines for compliance with safety standards for commercial zip line owners and operators. Research conducted at Ohio State University also concluded that only about 12 percent of zip line injuries result in a hospitalization. 

Ruebenstahl elaborated on the many potential benefits that a zip line could provide for student life at UCSB. Besides serving as a way to relieve stress for mental health initiatives, it is “a great project for engineer and physics students to collaborate on.”

“Also it would require a staff to work it, thus creating student jobs,” he added. 

Ruebenstahl encourages students who would like to collaborate on the zip line idea to reach out to him, especially physicists, mechanics, and graphic designers. ",4014
Human Sexuality Professors Refuse to Change Transphobic Content,"Sociology 152A: The Sociology of Human Sexuality (SOC152A) is a popular lower-division course offered at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB). Taught by married professors, John and Janice Baldwin, SOC152A aims to educate students on a variety of important and sensitive topics relating to sex, such as birth control and healthy relationships.

However, SOC152A has received several student complaints for using offensive and triggering terms when educating students about the transgender and gender non-conforming community. All complaints have been referred to the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) at UCSB.

One of the many offenses reported includes the use of the word “transgendered” throughout the SOC152A study guide. According to the GLAAD Media Reference Guide, using the adjective “transgender” with the extra “-ed” suffix causes unnecessary confusion about transgender identities and its use is considered problematic. 

“Sex reassignment surgery,” is also highlighted by GLAAD as a term to avoid, with the preferred term being Gender Confirmation Surgery (GCS). The Baldwins also include this in their study guide as one of the final stages of successfully transitioning. 

Additionally, the Baldwins choose to teach the incorrect claim that all transgender men are also heterosexual. Rachel Pollock, a third-year sociology major, explained that the information on the study guide is given directly to students during review sessions. 

“It was extremely binary,” said Pollock. “They talked a lot about how males versus females like sex, which made you feel weird if you didn’t fit into the behavior you were ‘supposed’ to do.”

The terms used by the Baldwins are largely considered problematic because they enforce the misconception that the defining step of the transitioning process is surgery and physical appearance, but not all trans people choose to medically transition. 

“ONE OF THE MANY OFFENSES REPORTED INCLUDES THE USE OF THE WORD “TRANSGENDERED” THROUGHOUT THE SOC152A STUDY GUIDE. ACCORDING TO THE GLAAD MEDIA REFERENCE GUIDE, USING THE ADJECTIVE “TRANSGENDER” WITH THE EXTRA “-ED” SUFFIX CAUSES UNNECESSARY CONFUSION ABOUT TRANSGENDER IDENTITIES AND ITS USE IS CONSIDERED PROBLEMATIC.”

This leads to transgender individuals being wrongfully perceived as deceptive for living as their authentic selves, which contributes to the high rate of violence experienced by the transgender community. 

In an interview with The Bottom Line, Craig Leets, Director of LGBT Resources at the RCSGD, explained why there has been little follow-up on student complaints received about the Baldwins’ classroom content. 

The Baldwins co-authored the textbook required for the class called “Discovering Human Sexuality,” meaning the professors have complete discretion to revise and change their course content. Despite complaints to the RCSGD, the Baldwins have chosen to continue teaching inaccurate information rather than listening to students who have felt uncomfortable or unwelcome in their classroom.

“Although I do not know if they have gone through formal channels, I have heard on-going complaints from students regarding SOC152A since I arrived at UCSB in the summer of 2018,” said Leets. “I was told when I arrived that advocacy had been occurring to change the content in that course for a while prior to my arrival.”

Analissa Nunez, a fourth-year sociology major, expressed her frustration with the Baldwins’ material for SOC152A after taking the class during the winter quarter of 2020: “The class is heavily heterosexuality focused and lacks a lot of information for LGBT students.”

“I know that they’re aware that students want them to focus on it, but they choose to ignore their requests,” Nunez continued. “It could be because of their age but that’s no excuse for not being able to transition your material to our current world.”

Additionally, Nunez mentioned the issue of triggering topics such as sexual assault also being taken too lightly in the course. 

Julie Winzelberg, a fourth-year communication major who also took SOC152A in winter quarter, described an instance in which an outdated video on the topic caused some students around her to become visibly upset. As students exited the class, Winzelberg stated that the Baldwins allegedly told students, “Remember, not all men are rapists.”

“I KNOW THAT THEY’RE AWARE THAT STUDENTS WANT THEM TO FOCUS ON IT, BUT THEY CHOOSE TO IGNORE THEIR REQUESTS,” NUNEZ CONTINUED. “IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE BUT THAT’S NO EXCUSE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO TRANSITION YOUR MATERIAL TO OUR CURRENT WORLD.”

“I was so appalled,” said Winzelberg. “That’s not even the point of what the lecture should be about and it’s also an awful thing to say about men.” 

A few options are available at UCSB for students who find course content discriminatory in regards to gender or sexual orientation. Students may report the course and its professors to the Office of Title IX or file a bias incident report. Another option includes talking to the appropriate department chair which oversees the course in question. 

Going through these entities may not result in any change because the Academic Freedom policy outlined in the Faculty Code of Conduct keeps professors like the Baldwins highly protected. 

“My understanding is that Academic Freedom provides protection to professors to decide to teach whatever content in their courses that they deem important to their curriculum,” stated Leets. 

The Baldwins are also able to ignore these student complaints because they are tenured faculty at UCSB. 

“Student evaluation feedback might be used in the process to grant tenure to a professor, so if they received a lot of negative feedback in student evaluations, a professor’s tenure process might be affected,” explained Leets. 

“Since the faculty of SOC152A are tenured, I do not think that negative student evaluation feedback has much, if any, impact on their continued teaching on campus.” ",2800
Gavin Newsom Announces Stay-At-Home Order,"Governor Gavin Newsom has ordered a three-week stay-at-home order last Tuesday, due to the increase of hospitalizations related to COVID-19 and reduced ICU capacity. The stay-at-home orders follow a surge in COVID-19 cases over the past three weeks and will go into full effect on Sunday night. 

Currently, Santa Barbara county has less than 15 percent availability of intensive care units and has reported an average of over 100 new cases of COVID-19 a day, according to the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department.  

All nonessential travel is prohibited and business such as bars, hair salons, and other personal services will be closed when the order goes into full effect. Some K-12 schools (with waivers), critical infrastructure, and retail stores will be open at 20 percent capacity. Restaurants will have both takeout and delivery but will be closed for outdoor dining for safety precautions. More information can be found on Public Health SBC.

The California Department of Public Health advises everyone to stay-at-home and only go out for essential needs. The California Department of Public Health mandates that businesses must require customers and employees to wear masks and follow social distancing guidelines within their establishments.",2141
Students & Native Hawaiians Fight to Protect Mauna Kea,"Since 2014, UC Regents has been an instrumental benefactor in funding the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) atop Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano on Hawaii Island. 

The project’s website states that the venture will “solidify the position of Hawaii as a World leader in research in astronomy and astrophysics,” as a sustainable advancement in science. According to the website, the project does not intrude on any archaeological sites or endangered wildlife on the island.

On Thursday, Nov. 12, a UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) organization by the name of Mauna Kea Protectors (MKP) held a workshop for their #UCDivestTMT campaign, which calls for funds for the project to be withdrawn. The workshop capped off the campaign’s week of action, calling for Chancellor Yang, the chairman of the project, to divest money from the TMT Project in accordance with Native Hawaiian students’ judgement and their UCSB supporters. 

The TMT project supporters have been pushing for the telescope’s completion in order to further study the space phenomenon of quasars. According to the online SAO Encyclopedia of Astronomy (COSMOS), quasars are celestial bodies that garner a tremendous amount of pure energy, theorized to be powered by immense black holes. Some astronomers believe the phenomenon represents a stage in the life of a galaxy, expanding outwards yet pulling old matter within. 

“ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, A UCSB ORGANIZATION BY THE NAME OF MAUNAKEA PROTECTORS (MKP) HELD A WORKSHOP FOR THEIR #UCDIVESTTMT CAMPAIGN, WHICH CALLS FOR FUNDS FOR THE PROJECT TO BE WITHDRAWN.”

“Through University of California Observatories, we have privileged access to the Keck telescopes on the summit of Mauna Kea, which allowed us to obtain high-quality data on this object shortly after it was discovered using the Gemini telescope,” commented physics professor Joe Hennawi in an interview with UCSB’s official news site, The Current. 

Members of the Hawaiian diaspora as well as natives of the island itself have demonstrated dissatisfaction with the venture. The summit is one of the most sacred places in Hawaiian cosmology, analogous to the “Garden of Eden” in Abrahamic religions. According to Trisha Kehualani, writer for Vox Magazine, Mauna Kea not only houses fragile natural resources, but also numerous cultural resources and “historic burial sites.”

TMT’s construction atop Mauna Kea has also promoted civil unrest within the Hawaiian community, as law enforcement has reportedly taken the opportunity to have native Hawaiian officers regulate the site without popular consent.

“The use of Native Hawaiian law enforcement has been met with harsh criticism,” reports Kehualani. “Many consider it an intentional decision by government leaders, who are primarily non-Hawaiian, to create division and trauma within the Hawaiian community.”

Native Hawaiians who want to preserve Mauna Kea do not agree that their fight is a conflict between science and culture. On the contrary, they are strong proponents for advancements in science, but simply believe the telescope does not belong on Mauna Kea. 

Earlier this May, the Daily Californian, a student-run newspaper at UC Berkeley, reported that the UC System newly invested a whopping $68 million into the Thirty-Meter Telescope project. Thus, the Mauna Kea Protectors at UCSB have led a student-backed resistance against the continuation of the project.

“NATIVE HAWAIIANS WHO WANT TO PRESERVE MAUNAKEA DO NOT AGREE THAT THEIR FIGHT IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN SCIENCE AND CULTURE. ON THE CONTRARY, THEY ARE STRONG PROPONENTS FOR ADVANCEMENTS IN SCIENCE, BUT SIMPLY BELIEVE THE TELESCOPE DOES NOT BELONG ON MAUNAKEA.”

The Mauna Kea Protectors’ workshop last Thursday kicked off with a brief introduction to the history of Mauna Kea, prefacing its significance to native Hawaiians. The presentation then explained UCSB’s involvement in the Mauna Kea project, specifically citing Yang’s public endorsement and leadership within the project, which extends back to before 2009. 

Along with being regarded as a violation of Mauna Kea’s spiritual significance, this project has also garnered further controversy as it led to the arrests of Hawaiian elders who peacefully protested on the Mauna Kea site in the summer of 2019. According to New York Times, authorities did not provide numbers of arrests and the charges, which the elders would anticipate, but witnesses described the scene as “emotional, but peaceful.”

Many UCSB students, even those outside of the Hawaiian community, feel strongly opposed to this issue. Student Jeike Meijer, who is a part of the Taino indigenous community from the Caribbean, aired her opinions on the Mauna Kea venture in a Q&A session following the presentation.

“MY EXPERIENCE WITH CHANCELLOR YANG HAS NOT FELT RECIPROCAL,” EXPLAINED STUDENT JEIKE MEIJER. “I HAVE NOT FELT LISTENED TO IN THE CONVERSATIONS, AND I HAVE NOT BEEN TAKEN SERIOUSLY.”

“My experience with Chancellor Yang has not felt reciprocal,” explained Meijer. “I have not felt listened to in the conversations, and I have not been taken seriously.”

This experience is not unique, as other UCSB students have taken to communicating with Yang over the phone, email, or social media to urge him and UC Regents to divest from the project. Yang has stated that he is in support of the Hawaiian community but has not expressed any intention to withdraw funds from the TMT project.",2322
AS President Application Officially Open,"UC Santa Barbara’s (UCSB) Associated Students (AS) Election Board has opened applications for the position of Associated Student president, which was announced to undergraduates in an email last Monday. 

The position is currently being filled by Internal Vice President Tianna White, who was promoted to interim president after the former AS President, Daevionne Beasley, resigned from his position in October. 

At the time of his resignation, Beasley faced backlash due to sexual assault allegations that surfaced in spring 2020.

Beasley has denied these allegations, calling them “unproven” and “completely unsubstantiated” in a Facebook post published earlier this year. 

“A good quality of a leader is knowing when to step up and when to step down. I realize now that there isn’t a way for me to move forward in the work I want to do for students,” Beasley added.

A special election for AS president will be held in the beginning of the winter quarter. All UCSB students are eligible to vote, although applications for the position will only be open to second- through fifth-year undergraduate students. 

Students who are interested in applying are encouraged to visit the AS Elections Board website for more information. The board will be accepting declarations of candidacy until Wednesday, Dec. 2 at 11:59 p.m.

Broadway: Now a Lost Way?,"On March 12, Broadway closed its doors due to an unforeseen spike in COVID-19 cases all around New York. The pandemic has left performers, technicians, and theater-goers all wondering when the shows we love so much will return to the stage. Will Elphaba ever defy gravity again? Will Evan Hansen keep waving through a window? Will Regina George ever get her revenge with the infamous Burn Book? Will Hamilton throw away his shot? 

The tenacity of what was once musical theatre was suddenly ripped out of our lives, tearing a hole in the heart of New York City. Theaters that once held hundreds of people, beautiful symphonies, and talented actors are now silent with only a ghost light to be found on stage. Even the streets of Broadway look like a ghost town. So how are Broadway’s creatives managing this painful loss, and what are Broadway’s plans for reopening to get their artists back to doing what they love?

Everyone is facing much uncertainty right now, but let us give the spotlight specifically to Broadway’s actors. To put matters in perspective, consider the case of one particular actress named NaTonia Monét, who worked her way to the top and finally got her Broadway debut. 

She was cast as Alline in “Tina: The Tina Turner Musical,” but then the pandemic surged through the country putting her dreams to a halt. In an interview with Zoe Jones from CBS News, she says, “I’m hurt. I worked so hard for this, like my other fellow artists, and it was snatched away. I feel like we artists were cast out by our administration.” She is coping by offering online acting lessons for children and taking virtual master classes to improve her craft. 

Monét is just one of many Broadway actors that have found themselves in a similar, troubling predicament. With his first Broadway debut last year, Arturo Luís Soria was sure he secured himself more opportunities in the 2020 season, but unfortunately, things didn’t go as planned. As a way to alleviate the temporary loss of his career, he started teaching acting classes via Zoom and is taking an endless road trip through the country, camping at national parks. 

“I want to be hopeful, but my gut feeling is that theater will be closed longer than we think,” he said.

Actors are not the only ones facing so much uncertainty in their careers. Technicians, designers, stagehands, composers, ushers, dancers, and choreographers — just to name a few — are going through the worst of it. 

Broadway supported approximately 96,900 local jobs within its industry. The takeaway is not that we have lost the arts, but that the country is failing to assist entire industries of people in dire need. When you take into consideration how much money Broadway makes in revenue, it changes your perspective of the entire industry. 

However, it is not solely Broadway that contributes to the high number of revenue brought from the arts, but other theaters around the country as well. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Arts and Culture make $877 billion in revenue, making up 4.5 percent of the American economy. How is it that an industry that encompasses so much is given little to no help during this global pandemic? When and how theaters will open again is a question that keeps changing. 

Broadway remains dark, with COVID-19 cases rising and more expected to come with this holiday season. The only light in the darkness amidst all of this are the ghost lights in the middle of what is now the ghost town of Times Square. Although Broadway has postponed their opening for May of next year, we still cannot be too sure of this; however, we can be hopeful. Broadway actor Abby Mueller gave her community some words of encouragement: “I love the Broadway community and believe we have the opportunity (and the responsibility) to come back stronger, more inclusive, compassionate, and equitable.”",1541
UCSB Introduces Voluntary COVID-19 Contact Tracing Technology,"The University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) recently announced a partnership with California COVID Notify, a voluntary smartphone-based COVID-19 notification system. The pilot program aims to reduce the spread of the virus by using technology to improve contact tracing. 

According to a campus-wide email sent out by UCSB officials on Nov. 16, the main goal of the pilot program is to “quickly notify users if they’ve likely been exposed to COVID-19, allowing them to seek medical attention and reduce the risk of exposure for friends, family, and the broader campus community.”

After the clinical success of the pilot program at UC San Francisco and UC San Diego, UCSB joins UC Davis, UC Riverside, UC Los Angeles, and UC Berkeley in an effort to test the effectiveness of the notification system. The program is currently only available to these select campuses until the system is introduced statewide. 

In an interview with The Bottom Line, Katie Mankins, director of Special Projects at UCSB, explained that California COVID Notify “uses the Bluetooth signal strength to determine if you’ve been in direct close contact with another user of the app, based on the latest guidance from the CDC.”

First, the system assigns a user’s phone a random identification number. Using the built-in emergency notification systems from Google and Apple, the system exchanges the random identification number with other users when phones are within six feet of each other for at least 15 minutes. 

A notable feature is the ability to exchange identification numbers with strangers who have opted-in to California COVID Notify. An individual is able to quickly learn whether they have been exposed to the virus beyond their inner social circle, such as when they are in close proximity to others who are waiting in line at a store or traveling at the same time. 

“Traditional contact tracing may not identify people you’ve come in contact with whom you don’t know personally since the interview questions are based on your recollection of where you were and who you were with,” Mankins stated. 

Vejas Skripkus, executive medical director of UCSB Student Health (SHS) confirmed that the user makes the explicit decision to turn on exposure notifications. 

“This app is completely voluntary and an individual can opt-in and out of the app as they please,” said Skripkus. “Privacy is preserved and the app does not share location information or collect, store, or transmit any personal information at any time.”

In order to protect user privacy and ensure confidentiality, the identification numbers change every 10-20 minutes. 

Someone who receives a verified positive test result can then choose whether or not to share the information with the app. A key code issued by a test provider is entered into the application, which generates anonymous push notifications to potentially infected users on instructions to get tested themselves.

“Our COVID-19 response team here at Student Health Services is issuing keys,” added Skripkus.

Users of California COVID Notify, however, should not solely rely on the contact tracing technology to slow the spread. Skripkus emphasized that the responsibility lies on the individual to protect themselves and others.

“It is important to wash your hands often, avoid close contact, socially distance, cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others, cover coughs and sneezes, and monitor your health daily,” Skripkus explained.

“I hope more UCSB-affiliated individuals sign up to use the app,” he continued. “It can really help in our efforts during this COVID-19 pandemic.”",1640
California’s New Curfew,"Governor Gavin Newsom and the Santa Barbara County Department of Public Health issued an order this past Thursday to undergo curfew due to COVID-19, which prohibits Californians from leaving the home for non-essential gatherings and work. 

According to the California Department of Public Health, this order excludes homeless people or “activities associated with the operation, maintenance, or usage of critical infrastructure, or required by law.” 

The COVID-19 curfew started on Saturday, Nov. 21, and will continue on a daily basis until Dec. 21 from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. 

With the virus increasing rapidly, the California Department of Public Health explained that the limited stay-at-home order will reduce opportunities for disease transmission with the goal of decreasing the number of hours individuals are in the community and mixing with individuals outside of their household.

The California Department of Public Health is motivated to decrease the number of the virus transmission for the Winter season as well as the number of hospitalizations for the next few weeks, which will help reduce the burden to the essential workers in a hospital.

Everyone is advised to stay at home and follow safety protocols, such as wearing a mask approved by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and implementing social distancing to decrease the spread of the virus. ",1301
Santa Barbara’s K-12 Schools Are Reopened For In-Person Classes,"The Santa Barbara county school district started the school year online, but through Governor Newsom’s public health order, the county has been able to open some schools for in-person classes. According to California’s Blueprint for a Safer Economy, counties that have maintained red tier transmission status — which indicates there is a substantial risk regarding COVID-19 — are sanctioned to conduct in-person classes. Santa Barbara county has been in the red tier for two weeks and began in-person instruction in K-12 schools on Oct. 13. 

In an interview with The Bottom Line, Susan Salcido — a UC Santa Barbara alumnus and superintendent of Santa Barbara county schools — explained the district’s plan for reopening. 

“Schools are opening campuses at different times as their governing boards carefully consider local factors, including regional COVID-19 data, the size and grade levels of the student body, the ability to physically distance within facilities, transportation, and the health and safety of students and staff,” Salcido said.

“Some Santa Barbara schools are located in rural areas and others in dense, populated urban areas, which makes reopening schools difficult and staggered across the county.”

Salcido went on to explain the complexity in opening schools, stating that some Santa Barbara schools are located in rural areas and others in dense, populated urban areas, which makes reopening schools difficult and staggered across the county.

The Bottom Line asked Salcido to elaborate on some of the risks of opening K-12 schools during the pandemic. Salcido emphasized the work the county is doing and plans to address student, staff, and parent mental health in order to make everybody feel safe with the reopening of schools. 

“Our school districts [will] continue to work closely with the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department to safely reopen, and keep open, our schools,” Salcido explained. 

The county’s concerns address the weight on the teachers to feel safe and able to teach the students to the best of their abilities, as well as students’ and parents’ safety in the re-opening process. 

Parents and educators have been raising awareness of the risks in sending students back to learn in person. Salcido has received “emails, texts, and phone calls daily from parents, students, and teachers worried about learning loss and mental health in the isolation of distance learning, and COVID-19 impacts as schools reopen.” 

“The county’s concerns address the weight on the teachers to feel safe and able to teach the students to the best of their abilities, as well as students’ and parents’ safety in the re-opening process.”

However, Salcido also mentioned that there has been positive feedback from students currently attending in-person class, making it difficult to find a happy medium. She expressed the difficulty in compromising between the needs of parents, teachers, and students, who all have valid concerns about safety but also want to make meaningful in-person connections. Ultimately, Salcido concluded, “there is not a one-size-fits-all answer, but we will continue to work together to find solutions that will bring students and teachers back to campuses safely.”",3270
UCSB Students Experience A New Normal,"The UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) student experience feels more fractured than ever. With remote learning distancing our relationships to the campus and each other, what it means to be a gaucho is ambiguous. Although the change from in-person to remote classes has been difficult, not all students have felt the same way.

I interviewed two UCSB students about what their college experience has been and how it has changed since last March. Currently, classes are being taught synchronously or asynchronously, an abrupt change compared to how classes were taught last year. Without the normal classroom experience, students are finding it difficult to interact with professors and other students, making it an isolated experience.

 “I love recorded lectures,” said Michelle Politiski, a fourth-year writing and literature major. “It just makes sense, for accessibility reasons — I’d love to be able to sit through an in-person lecture and just listen, and be able to pull up a video of that lecture later on to take notes on the material.” 

“Without the normal classroom experience, students are finding it difficult to interact with professors and other students, making it an isolated experience.”

Though she enjoys learning at her own pace, she’s found that her professors aren’t as accommodating with students like they were with last spring quarter. Now, it appears that students are expected to be fully prepared and adjusted when it’s not the case for a majority of students. “I’ve experienced a lot of difficulties remembering which assignments are due on which days because frankly, I’m much more used to being reminded when I show up to class,” Politiski said.

Other students are finding it hard to adjust to remote instruction because they don’t feel like they’re fully grasping the material like they would in an in-person class. Alexandra Wishowski, a fourth-year linguistics major explained her difficulties with retaining information this quarter: “I can’t learn by reading because I have to be in the lecture to learn which helps me do less studying for tests. It’s more time consuming for me to reread things over and over again because I can’t absorb the information, there’s a reason why I never missed an in-person lecture.”

Along with her difficulties comes the reality of graduating this spring. As a transfer student, Wishowski only experienced two in-person quarters at UCSB and had planned to become involved in research during the spring. With most research opportunities being paused, it’s harder to find remote experiences. 

In contrast, Politiski shared how her post-graduation plans haven’t been derailed as she plans to take some gap years before applying to graduate school while working during that period. However, with the current state of the economy, finding reliable work is a genuine worry for her. She hopes that by the time she does apply to graduate school, we’ve returned to normal, but to a slight extent.

“Now, it appears that students are expected to be fully prepared and adjusted when it’s not the case for a majority of students.”

Aside from academics, another harsh reality is the lack of connections that students have made since beginning the school year. 

Nallely Carillo, a new transfer student majoring in sociology, explained her struggle with making friends after she moved to Isla Vista. “I only have two years here so I want to make the most of my experience. Most of the new people I’ve met have been through my roommates so I’ve been able to make some connections,” Carillo explained.

Even though she’s making connections virtually, Carillo has still been able to find a community by joining the UCSB Legal Education Association for Diversity, a pre-law club to gain advice on applying to law school in the future.

Although quarantine has temporarily halted our lives, college students can find positivity in these challenging times and bond over our similar experiences. For many, this pandemic has been a period of healing and personal growth as we learn to accept our “new” normal.",902
The Armenia and Azerbaijan Crisis Reaches UCSB,"As tensions escalate in the longtime Azerbaijan conflict, around 10 UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) students — organized by the UCSB Armenian Students Association (ASA) — gathered for their second rally to speak out towards their support of the Republic of Artsakh and Armenia on Oct. 24. 

Ania, an economics and accounting major and the treasurer of ASA, gave The Bottom Line insight on the protest: “Our group includes members of ASA and our allies … We placed posters, went through Isla Vista, and tried to bring awareness [about the aggression of the Azerbajiani government on Armenians] to the community.” 

The rally received attention from the community as people asked questions regarding the crisis and inquired about ways to lend a hand. Besides holding hand-written protest signs, the protesters started conversation with people passing by. “We want to get the message across through our words,” Ania said. 

A UCSB alumnus that has been working in ASA for four years participated in the rally as well saying, “It was heartwarming to see students with no connection to Armenia or ASA coming by, willing to know about what’s going on and get into the conversation.” 

The protesters were met with blank stares and uninformed questioning from some people in the community, who inquired about the reason for the protest, further raising protesters’ concerns for low news coverage surrounding the Armenian people and the crisis. 

The UCSB alumnus was disappointed in these people’s reactions. “There are students that have no idea how to react. They walked by while giggling, with no idea about the reasons why we protest, while our people face the genocide and extermination. We have friends and families on the frontline! These people’s actions can be a little frustrating for us.” 

The protest progressed free of conflict and all students who joined were required to wear masks and maintain social distance. 

“We are protesting for peace and defending ourselves from future genocide. With that, when we come to protest, it comes with pain and empathy,” Ania explained. “We want others to support us, but not create enemies. Our protests are peaceful because of our intentions.”

At the end of the interview with Ania, she also talked about ASA’s goals. “We are only a small community, we cannot get the exposure we need without the help of other people … I wish more people would join, and for the movement to reach from local communities to a more national audience. It really means a lot.” 

In order to plan for the rally and run it smoothly, ASA created a poll on its official Instagram page to determine availability for potential participants. Their official Instagram account, UCSB ASA, is used to communicate and send information to students and alumni who are willing to offer support. 

Marching through Isla Vista and down Del Playa, ASA held its first rally 10 days prior to the second. This initial rally was larger, however, and consisted of about 25 people. Because lots of Armenian students went back home to Los Angeles during the weekend, the second rally did not create an impact as strong as the first, which was held on Wednesday. 

“We made a lot of progress for the first rally because many people came out of their houses to watch and see what we were protesting about,” Ania said. 

To support the Armenian crisis, UCSB’s Associated Students Senate (AS) has adopted a resolution for Armenians in Armenia and the Republic of Artsakh. Senator Esmeralda Quintero-Cubilian and Senator Ahura Nezhard introduced the resolution at an AS meeting on Oct 21. 

Before presenting the resolution, the two senators directly reached out to the UCSB Armenian community in order to properly represent them and to hear any concerns.

“I do believe we need to focus on what the Armenian community itself is dealing with. Even though there was a mention of it through this resolution, we took the first step to make it recognized,” Nezhard said. 

Besides providing background information on the 6 week long conflict, Esmeralda Quintero-Cubilian and Ahura Nezhard added a statement from Armenian students. 

“We took a lot of emotional tone from them … Rephrased their own words … I think further steps would require us [the AS Senate] to focus on the concerns that the Armenian population are dealing with, ” Nezhard said.",2049
U.S. News Ranking’s Impact on International Students,"A recent list unveiled by the U.S. News & World Report ranked the best global universities and has sparked discussion among international students about how to evaluate American universities during the application season. 

U.S. News & World Report — a well-known global authority in university rankings — recently released a list of 2021’s best global universities, which raised eyebrows among international students. A ranking for Qufu Normal University, a relatively undistinguished university, placed its math department and major as the best in Asia and as the top 19th worldwide. 

This ranking has surprised many international students because Qufu University was never known for its math department. Xiaoyu Liu, a second-year Chinese student majoring in financial mathematics, commented on how she and her friends were surprised by this news. “Because China has 34 provinces in total, some universities are only popular in their own province. However, my friends from Shandong, which is where Qufu Normal University is located, said it is not one of the best universities here.” 

According to U.S. News & World Report’s official website, the subject-specific rankings are created based on each university’s “academic research performance,” which is evaluated by weighing the number of citations and publications of conducted research. In addition, the global and regional research reputation of a university is also taken into account when ranking the hard science subjects, such as mathematics. 

Qufu Normal University was not placed on the ministry’s list of first-class discipline construction; the list is made by the Ministry of Education (MOE), aiming to objectively rank Chinese universities. As a matter of fact, it was rated a B minus from the Chinese MOE’s fourth round of nationwide subject review. 

“I found many high school students, who are planning to study in the United States, are confused by this news. Rankings often provide guidance for these Chinese students to choose American universities,” Liu said. 

In response to these concerns, Cuca Acosta, the Associated Director of the UC Santa Barbara Office of Admissions, believes both domestic and international students are making more rational decisions based on factors aside from rankings.  

“The rankings across the United States are vast … and the concept behind these rankings is to look into the minutiae. Most individuals do not know the small differences between rankings,” Acosta explained. “The U.S. News looked at the alumni giving, while other rankings may look into the publications.”

Acosta suggests that international students should try to understand the best fit for them, instead of simply taking the highest rankings as their best option. Choosing universities is more than comparing rankings as more specific aspects based on students’ own preferences should also be considered.

“I think all students, no matter where they live, shall look for the universities that can benefit them in their future career to be in a graduate school or in the industry. I also think more and more students are making this decision as a family unit,” Acosta said. “Many students are also looking for universities where there are particular programs that they are interested in; and that is good.”

Erika Shinoda, a Japanese senior majoring in communication and theater, works as a mentor for Japanese high school students and helps them choose universities. 

“The most important thing is to study what they want to study. I told the high school students to list up any values they can think of, and choose which value matches your own value. Then match the schools with your preferred values,” Shinoda said. 

Shinoda also suggests rankings could help students get to know different universities when doing school research. 

“Ranking is definitely a consideration for many Japanese students as the first step of searching schools because that is a way to narrow all the universities down,” explained Shinoda. “But in terms of the last decision-making process, I feel it is not as important as your other values like what you want to study. The values depend on different people.”",789
AS President Daevionne Beasley’s Resignation,"On Oct. 25, Associated Students (AS) President Daevionne Beasley released a statement detailing his resignation from his elected office. The decision followed a series of contentions with Beasley’s election, which has been petitioned for recall under accusations of sexual assault.

Beasley’s statement clarified that he will leave office on Thursday, Oct. 29, to best facilitate the transition of power between him and former Internal Vice President, Tianna White. The office of Internal Vice President will then be filled by Senate first pro-tempore, Catherine Flaherty.

In the past few weeks, AS has come under intense scrutiny for Beasley’s election, who multiple students accused of sexual assault starting from 2018. According to a statement released by the Isla Vista Party (IVP) back in April of this year, Beasley had been barred from queer spaces and events for sexual assault survivors due to the allegations. IVP themselves had even denied his application to run with their party after becoming aware of the allegations from before. 

“Beasley’s statement clarified that he will leave office on Thursday, Oct. 29, to best facilitate the transition of power between him and former Internal Vice President, Tianna White.”

The Instagram page, @Gauchos4Transparency, rose to prominence this May after creating a petition to recall Beasley’s election, which was just approved this October after two previously unsuccessful attempts. The organization’s founder, Izzy Mitchell, took to social media and email to ask for elected AS officials to speak for survivors, urging them to respond to emails asking for a stand against Beasley in light of his allegations. 

Multiple officials from the party chose to not respond. Some students saw it as a precaution; some saw it as avoiding accountability. The AS president at the time, Alison Sir, even put her social media on a temporary lockdown on May 19, regarding the ways in which students had chosen to approach her as “extremely inappropriate.”

Since the recent approval of the recall election, Gauchos 4 Transparency has provided their base with coverage on AS meetings discussing the details of the recall. One significant issue raised with the election has been the constituency of voters, which now includes first-year transfers and freshmen. Beasley filed an injunction asking for them to not be included in the recall election, as they were not part of the same voter population that elected him.

“In the past few weeks, AS has come under intense scrutiny for Beasley’s election, who multiple students accused of sexual assault starting from 2018. According to a statement released by the Isla Vista Party (IVP) back in April of this year, Beasley had been barred from queer spaces and events for sexual assault survivors due to the allegations.”

At the AS meeting on Oct. 21, AS voted 18-3 to overturn the injunction to not count any signatures on the petition from freshmen or first-year transfer students. According to a statement released by the UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) AS Elections Board on Oct. 23, they believed from the beginning that the details on the recall case should have been made accessible to all students, even new admits for the current school year.

“[We believe] that the use of judicial power to limit free discussion is dangerous,” clarified the AS Elections Board in their statement. “Even though we do not agree, we will be fully complying with the judicial order.”

Online activism platforms like Gauchos 4 Transparency have voiced their dissatisfaction with the injunction. On their Instagram page, founder Izzy Mitchell declared that anyone attending the university has a right for their voice to be heard.

“[Everyone pays] $200 to Associated Students every year,” stated Mitchell on her Instagram page. “This is the injunction by AS president to block his recall by attempting to disenfranchise nearly 20 percent of the UCSB student population, who are all due paying constituents.” ",1421
COVID-19 Changes Voting Options for Santa Barbara County,"This year, registered California voters have demonstrated record numbers of early voting. With the COVID-19 pandemic showing no signs of slowing down, voters in Santa Barbara County have cast nearly 140,000 vote-by-mail ballots as of Nov. 1, with almost all of these ballots being accepted by the county. 

According to Joseph E. Holland of the County of Santa Barbara Clerk-Recorder, Assessor, and Elections Department (CARE), every registered voter in the state of California received a vote-by-mail ballot this year to discourage in-person voting. 

“We’ve never done 100 percent vote-by-mail in California before,” said Holland in an interview with The Bottom Line.

In the Isla Vista and UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) area, there will be two polling locations this year: the Isla Vista Community Center and the Linda Vista room at the Santa Catalina undergraduate residence hall. Another polling location near the Isla Vista area is set up at the Hilton Garden Inn on Hollister Avenue and Glenn Annie Road. 

Beginning Oct. 31, the Isla Vista locations will be open before Election Day for the first time. “These are going to be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, and Monday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m,” explained Holland. 

On Election Day, these polling places will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. UCSB students are also able to conveniently drop off their vote-by-mail ballots at the dropbox in front of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol Station located at 6504 Trigo Road. 

To protect the health and safety of in-person voters and poll workers, Holland explained that the Santa Barbara County Elections Division is going “the whole nine yards” to prevent the spread of COVID-19. 

The safety measures put in place include full personal protective equipment for poll workers, enforced requirements to follow social distancing protocols, and the disinfecting of stations between voters. Voters are also required to wear masks at all times.

 “We’re going to provide masks if you don’t have one,” stated Holland. 

Holland also noted that statistics from Oct. 30 indicate a total of 235,000 registered voters in Santa Barbara County and 127,000 returned ballots. The resulting 54 percent voter turnout four days before Election Day suggests that polling locations in the county are less likely to attract large crowds and long lines. 

Holland also shed light on how the county is devising precautions for other safety concerns, such as potential unrest over the results of the election. Although no threats are anticipated, the county is proactively working with the Sheriff’s Office and other law enforcement authorities. 

“We are prepared on multiple levels,” said Holland. “Whether it’s a fire or a protest, or a power shutdown, or people getting COVID-19 at a polling location.”

In addition, Holland strongly advises students who are able to use alternative voting methods to avoid waiting until Election Day on Nov. 3 to cast their ballots in-person. “There’s no reason to wait until Tuesday,” he said.

“If students need to change their address to register to vote in Isla Vista, they can do that on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and even on Election Day,” he continued. 

Online voter registration is available at RegisterToVote.ca.gov. Further information on voter registration and voting options specific to Santa Barbara County can be found at sbcvote.com. ",1040
Kyle’s Kitchen Opens in Isla Vista,"Kyle’s Kitchen is a local restaurant chain that sells burgers and salads. With locations in Santa Barbara, Goleta, and now Isla Vista (IV), they place a special emphasis on sustainability and philanthropy. They use fresh non-frozen potatoes for their french fries and their chicken is antibiotic free. 

Their mission is inspired by the owners’ son, Kyle, a special-needs child who thrived after going through a program called, The Institutes for The Achievement of Human Potential. Kyle’s Kitchen was created for them to give back to the community. They donate money every month to an organization that supports people with special needs. 

The Bottom Line interviewed Emily Kadri — the marketing manager for Kyle’s Kitchen — to gain some insight about the opening of Kyle’s Kitchen in Isla Vista and to understand how they are adapting their business model to the COVID-19 pandemic.  

“In terms of adjusting to the pandemic, we have gone above and beyond local government regulations for customer and staff safety in our restaurants…

The opening of Kyle’s Kitchen in Isla Vista was not planned before COVID-19, but was created as a way for the owners to adapt to the changing circumstances of the college town. “We had to pivot and shift from Silvergreens to Kyle’s IV due to the strains COVID-19 put on the business . . . 

“The owners have four school-age kids, including Kyle who has special needs, and pre-pandemic five restaurants (Silvergreens, Kyle’s Kitchen, and Kyle’s Protein Grill) . . .  Once UCSB [UC Santa Barbara] resumed we wanted to open our IV location again, but in the vein of simplification, we transitioned Silvergreens into Kyle’s IV to streamline operations and the owner’s lives,” Kardi explained.

…We use a weekly virus vaporizer service that coats all surfaces in the restaurant with a food-safe and hospital-grade disinfectant that lasts up to a week and kills all viruses, including COVID-19, on surface contact.”

We use a weekly virus vaporizer service that coats all surfaces in the restaurant with a food-safe and hospital-grade disinfectant that lasts up to a week and kills all viruses, including COVID-19, on surface contact,” continued Kardia. “Additionally, all staff wear masks and gloves while working, and are temperature checked before each shift. Plus, we encourage employees who aren’t feeling well to stay home,” continued Kardi.

Kadri also listed several things Kyle’s Kitchen has planned to fit the demographics of the young students in Isla Vista, which includes a new online ordering system through an app, advanced rewards programs, changed closing hours from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m., and “a discounted late-night combo that will appeal to students who wait to eat dinner or are hungry after 8 p.m.” 

Kyle’s Kitchen in Isla Vista is located where Silvergreens used to be down at the intersection of Pardall and Embarcadero. It opens at 11 a.m. 

Their menu is simple with several different types of salads, burgers, and fries. They discount a different item on their menus each week which encourages customers to try different things. Their burgers are high quality with flavors that allow them to differentiate themselves from other competitors in Isla Vista. Their prices are also in line with the places around them.

Jesus Burgers Continues to Serve Isla Vista Amidst COVID-19,"On Friday nights during a typical school year, it was typical to see a long line of partygoers on the lawn of 6686 Del Playa Drive. The location, a community residence for Isla Vista Church (IVC) members known as the Jesus Burger house, spread their message of Christianity to college students through free hamburgers. 

With a mustard cross and a ketchup heart, IVC’s Jesus Burgers has been an Isla Vista staple for the past two decades. Since its inception in 2001, over 100,000 Jesus Burgers have been served. 

The church’s mission is “to bring the gospel of Jesus to the city of Isla Vista and to see it transformed from an infamous party city into a city filled with the light and love of Jesus.”

Following restrictions and shutdowns of many businesses in Santa Barbara County, the fate of these Friday night burgers was largely unknown for the new school year at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB). In an interview with The Bottom Line (TBL), lead pastor Jason Lomelino detailed how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed operations for Jesus Burgers. 

“We’re still hosting it at the house for the people who live there,” said Lomelino. “We shut down the whole Friday night to avoid the chaos.” 

Rather than welcoming guests into the yard, the new Jesus Burger setup is what Lomelino describes as “more like a walk-by.” Isla Vista (IV) residents are now able to swing by the Jesus Burger house at around 6 p.m. on Friday nights to grab a freshly grilled burger. 

Around 200 hamburgers were served to rowdy crowds of hungry college students at the Jesus Burger house each Friday. With COVID-19 continuing to spread within the Isla Vista area, Lomelino states that the group “dropped down to serving about 100 or so hamburgers.”

It is uncertain when Jesus Burgers will finally resume its normal operation. Lomelino clarified that Jesus Burgers will follow county public health guidelines for the safe reopening of businesses, rather than risking a large public gathering that puts the community at risk. 

Respecting the health and safety of Isla Vista residents is an even higher priority for Jesus Burgers after photos of IVC gatherings showing maskless attendants were featured on the Instagram account @ucsb.party, putting the church on the receiving end of bad publicity. 

Lomelino addressed this by clarifying that these types of gatherings have permission to meet outside legally. 

The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) provides industry guidelines for places of worship, stating that “outdoor attendance should be limited naturally through implementation of strict physical distancing measures of a minimum of six feet between attendees from different households.” Additionally, face coverings are required.

Lomelino explained that the IVC house hosts people every Sunday for church services, with leaders asking attendants to wear a mask and sit only with people in their immediate households. 

Hosting smaller gatherings has proved to be a challenge due to the community-style housing for the church’s members. 

“Fourteen people live in the Jesus Burger house so they sit all together and we have multiple community houses of 10 people so it just doesn’t always look the best on paper or to the visual eye,” said Lomelino. 

“We’re trying to do everything we can to adhere to what is being asked for church services in California,” he continued.

Lomelino added that people outside the church have been welcomed to help serve Jesus Burgers, but says that the opportunity will only be available when social distancing guidelines are lifted. 

“No one can join besides people living in the house,” he said. “They’re trying to make sure everyone has their gloves and masks on and won’t draw a crowd.”

Signing up for an internship with IVC includes officially assisting to serve Jesus Burgers. Currently, the cost of an internship with IVC is $150 per week.

From the perspective of the IVC, the Friday night burger giveaways aim to reflect God that loves all people  — an image that Lomelino has noticed often does not come to mind when most people think of Christianity.

“I think a hamburger is just symbolic of God’s love for everyone in the simplest form,” stated Lomelino. 

The Jesus Burgers ministry has also driven intoxicated people home and offered their bathrooms, water, and prayers to community members to spread their message. The IVC also hopes to build an equipping center called the “Field of Dreams” to house and train its members, interns, and pastor Jason Lomelino. 

Everyone — Christian or not — is welcome to visit the Jesus Burger house for a kind word and a free hamburger. Donations to support the ministry can be made on Isla Vista Church’s website.",1750
"UCSB Housing, Dining, & Auxiliary Enterprises Reports $40 Million Revenue Drop","After a major loss in revenue during the Spring quarter, UC Santa Barbara Housing, Dining & Auxiliary (UCSB) Enterprises continues to take a hit from COVID-19, leading some officials to call the situation “a challenge” and “stressful for everyone.”

In an email sent to The Bottom Line, Director of News and Media Relations Andrea Estrada said that the office is “seeing a $40 million reduction for Fall 2020.” Estrada did not disclose how much revenue the housing department makes in a typical school year, nor is this information published in the University of California’s 2018-2019 Financial Report.

The remote Fall quarter has continued a coronavirus-induced downturn for the university, with on-campus housing reaching an all-time low. According to Mario Munoz, assistant director of Housing & Residential Services, a total of 119 undergraduates have been permitted to move into on-campus housing this quarter, with another 274 undergraduates being placed in one of three Tropicana Student Living complexes adjacent to UCSB.

Only students with “special circumstances” have been permitted to do so, in line with the school’s Fall Instruction and Campus Housing memo released on Aug. 28. When asked to define “special circumstances,” Munoz said this included Guardian Scholars, Unaccompanied Homeless Youth, Promise Scholars, dance or music majors taking in-person classes, athletes required to be on campus, and international students unable to return to their home countries. 

“Students with truly extenuating circumstances that would prevent them from successfully attending school remotely” were also allowed to move into on-campus housing, he added.

According to Munoz, approximately 15.5 percent of university-owned housing is currently occupied for fall quarter — up slightly from the 93 percent of cancelled housing contracts in spring, when COVID-19 prompted an exodus of over 7,000 students living on campus back to their family homes.

“WE HAVE BEEN FACING AN EVER-CHANGING LANDSCAPE, WITH A LOT OF UNKNOWNS,” SAID MARIO MUNOZ, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR AND HOUSING AND RESIDENTIAL SERVICES. “MANY STUDENTS AND PARENTS EXPERIENCE FRUSTRATION WHEN THEY EXPECT ANSWERS FROM US THAT WE DO NOT HAVE, AND THAT CAN BE STRESSFUL FOR EVERYONE.”

“The housing department is taking a loss,” previous Assistant Director Jill Hurd told The Bottom Line in April, although at the time, Hurd said she didn’t know the exact amount the school would be losing.

Other colleges have reported similar losses — feeling the effects of a closed campus and low dorm occupancy rates. On Oct. 11, UC San Diego Chancellor Pradeep Khosla said that the school had a projected loss of up to $450 million due to the pandemic, noting that 5,000 fewer students than expected are living on campus for fall quarter. UC Berkeley Chancellors Carol Christ and Paul Alivisatos gave similar statistics, reporting a projected loss of $340 million and “nearly vacant” residence halls.

Although UC Santa Barbara has not released total projected losses, the university has been criticized by community members for making budget adjustments due to lost revenue, which has included layoffs of university employees and imposing regular tuition and fees despite remote instruction.

When asked if another quarter of remote instruction would lead to consequences for employees and students — such as additional layoffs or hiked tuition — Estrada declined to speculate. “Many of the costs covered by campus-based fees continue even in the current crisis, such as debt service for student facilities and campus infrastructure maintenance,” she said. 

Outside the $40 million deficit, Munoz said that COVID-19 was a stressor for the housing department, complicating day-to-day operations. “It has been a challenge moving to a remote work environment,” he said. “We have the technical tools to do our jobs, such as data access and continuity of our email and phone systems, but the team being situated in different physical spaces can be difficult sometimes.”

“We have been facing an ever-changing landscape, with a lot of unknowns,” Munoz added. “Many students and parents experience frustration when they expect answers from us that we do not have, and that can be stressful for everyone.”",1236
Santa Barbara County Cracks Down on COVID Safety Violations,"On Tuesday Oct. 20, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance that allows local law enforcement to fine community members in violation of public health orders, such as not wearing a mask and hosting large gatherings during COVID-19.

The ordinance would be applied to unincorporated areas such as Isla Vista. If adopted, the ordinance would enter into force within 30 days and remain in force until the local pandemic emergency declaration is terminated or the ordinance is revoked by the board.

Gref Hart, chair of the Santa Barbara County Board, said that the ordinance was passed due to a recent uptick in COVID-19 cases, particularly in Isla Vista. 

“A few months ago, the second wave of virus was a fear for the future, it’s now reality,” Hart said in a press hearing. “If cases or the test positivity rate were to increase significantly, the progress we’ve made together as a community could be reversed, business … operating restrictions and closures.”

PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE LEADING CONTRACT TRACING AND EDUCATION OUTREACH EFFORTS IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 IN ISLA VISTA.

After gathering opinions and comments from approximately 40 community members, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors approved the public health ordinance on Nov. 10, which passed by a vote of 3-2.

The board previously did not pass the ordinance when they took the first vote in August. At that time, they focused on educating and persuading community members, such as handing out masks to them instead of imposing a fine. 

“The county enforcement process is still focused on education and outreach, but it incorporates enforcement for individuals who continue to violate local health orders,” said Kelly Hubbard, the director of the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management. 

According to student organization Gauchos4Transparency, the ordinance imposes fines ranging from $100 to $500, with a maximum fine of $1,000 or a 90-day jail sentence if a public health misdemeanor is reported and verified.

“The county enforcement process is still focused on education and outreach, but it incorporates enforcement for individuals who continue to violate local health orders.”

During the past month, there have been two separate clusters of positive COVID-19 cases identified by UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) and the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (SBCPHD). Both discovered in privately-owned fraternity and sorority houses in Isla Vista. UCSB did not disclose which Greek organizations were affiliated with the outbreak, but said that the COVID-19 positive-individuals were isolating from others and houses were quarantined by SBCPHD. 

Many community members have expressed outrage over the recent uptick in cases. Eric Sun, a senior international student majoring in mathematics, expressed his disappointment: “I was shocked by this news. Two separate clusters of positive COVID-19 cases mean it is not at the level of several individuals, it is that a large proportion of the student group is not paying enough attention to the second wave of the pandemic.”

Bruce Fan, the AS Program Board (AS) student representative, also presented his opinion, “Students should be responsible to not only themselves, but also to each other. The ordinance is trying to stop the spread of the scope.”

Public health officials are leading contract tracing and education outreach efforts in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in Isla Vista. “The culture we’re trying to promote is education. We only transition to enforcement if that doesn’t work,” said Das Williams, the first district supervisor.

The ordinance has been widely supported by UCSB students and Isla Vista community members. More than 25 UCSB students sent in letters and over 10 people spoke in public comment, Gauchos4Transparency said in its Instagram post last Tuesday. 

“I highly support the ordinance. Although I think the ordinance may not be sufficiently effective in private-owned areas, it is worthy to take an important step,” Sun concluded.",1165
UCEAP Moves Forward with 2021 Study Abroad Plans,"On Aug. 20, the University of California’s Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) canceled all winter quarter programs and a majority of spring semester programs scheduled for 2021. As of Oct. 16, only 25 programs are scheduled to run during the spring semester, starting after March 15. 


According to an update letter issued on Aug. 25 by Vivian-Lee Nitray — the executive director of UCEAP — “UC Policy precludes UCEAP from operating in any countries where the US Department of State issues travel advisories of level three or higher, or where the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] issues health notices of alert level two or three.” 

To learn more about what studying abroad looks like in the midst of this unpredictable pandemic, the Bottom Line sat down for an interview with professor Juan Campo, the faculty director of UCEAP at UC Santa Barbara (UCSB). 

UCEAP is working extremely hard to move on with the continuation of programs in 2021 as planned. Campo confirmed that students are still being placed in their designated program for the Spring of 2021, but UCEAP is now mainly recruiting for the Fall and full-year programs. 

Currently, UCEAP has been holding informational sessions for potential applicants to begin planning their time abroad.

“During the summer, several hundred students and parents attended,” said Campo about the informational sessions. “We know the interest is out there and we’re trying to find ways to keep students excited and engaged.” 

Campo also addressed how the COVID-19 bombshell delayed the decision-making process for canceling programs earlier this year. Following the suspension of Spring 2020 programs on March 12 and the suspension of all summer and fall programs soon after, UCEAP is now finalizing their plans earlier and striving to notify students more promptly.

“They set a deadline by the end of September to make a decision on the post-March 15 spring programs,” said Campo.

In the case that serious and unforeseeable events happen after programs are finalized, UCEAP has reached an agreement with the registrar’s office to make sure that students who are affected by a program’s suspension still have priority to enroll in classes at UCSB on GOLD. 

Changes regarding the continuation of programs may vary with the preferences of the host university, however. Additionally, UCEAP runs and manages its own programs and also contracts third-party providers to run programs for them stating, “We have to adjust according to the preferences of each of those three tiers.” 

UCEAP is working extremely hard to move on with the continuation of programs in 2021 as planned. Campo confirmed that students are still being placed in their designated program for the Spring of 2021, but UCEAP is now mainly recruiting for the Fall and full-year programs. 
UCEAP programs scheduled to continue have been changed to accommodate UCEAP participants, such as limiting their capacities to admit a smaller number of students. 

“In one of our programs in Asia — I believe it’s in Shanghai — the university has set a lower cap on the number of students that can go in relation to their concerns about maintaining a safe classroom environment,” explained Campo. 

Although COVID-19 conditions and travel restrictions vary by region, UC students are not able to submit an application to more than one program as a backup option. Campo explained that UCEAP is set up for one application at a time because there are different deadlines and requirements for the programs offered. 

“The best thing for a student to do is to sketch out what is their most preferred program in their meetings with our advisors, and what might be the options if that doesn’t happen,” said Campo.

“Even for students that plan to graduate in June — given that they haven’t had too many units — we can still allow them to go for an extra quarter after graduation with EAP,” he continued. In addition, UCEAP plans to host more information sessions about post-graduate opportunities abroad. 

Campo encourages students interested in going abroad to take the chance and apply on MyEAP to the various programs offered for the 2021-22 school year, as it is free of cost to complete the process. UCSB students can also take advantage of advisors’ drop-in hours for assistance. 

The University of California’s Education Abroad Program continues to closely monitor the COVID-19 outbreak for its participants with guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO), Student Health (SHS), and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC). 

Current information on COVID-19 travel conditions by destination can be found on the U.S. Department of State’s website and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",1267
How the Armenia and Azerbaijan Crisis Affects Students,"In response to the devastating crisis progressing in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, The Bottom Line sat down with UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) Armenian students, Stepanian and Assadourian, to discuss the emotional turmoil Armenians everywhere are experiencing as their country delves further into instability.

As a historical preface, Nagorno-Karabakh’s population and culture are mainly Armenian, but the region was officially allocated to Azerbaijan by the Soviet Union. With the gradual fall of communism, however, both Armenia and Azerbaijan claimed sovereignty from Russia, and thus began territorial disputes leading to the 1988 Nagorno-Karabakh War where thousands died and hundreds of thousands were displaced on both sides.

As Armenian forces gained control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, a shaky ceasefire was signed in 1994, ending immediate fighting but not solving the larger territorial issue. Conflicts between the two states have risen since but not particularly to a severe degree. 

Now functioning as a mostly separatist state, Nagorno-Karabakh is politically controlled by Armenian figures supported by the Armenian government to Azerbaijan’s dismay. 

Political tensions between the two countries boiled over on Sept. 27 when Armenia accused Azerbaijan military forces of bombing Nagorno-Karabakh towns and cities without any reasonable provocation. Azerbaijan responded with accusations stating that Armenia had shot down Azerbaijan military aircraft and was to be met with severe retaliation.

Since then, Azerbaijan has hastily approved a controversial offensive, marked by excessive use of artillery shellings on civilian populations. As of Sept. 27, the Nagorno-Karabakh region has witnessed 31 civilian deaths, 532 military deaths, and hundreds of hospitalized civilians.

To make matters worse, Turkey has allegedly sent weapons and Syrian mercenaries to support Azerbaijan against Armenia.

Fourth-year UCSB student Assadourian, majoring in psychology and brain sciences with a minor in sociolinguistics, finds herself in a constant state of worry as news about the Armenian crisis gradually becomes more critical. 

“I see my mental health going on a decline. I see myself … neglecting my classes because this is all I can think about. Because my people’s existence is under threat,” said Assadourian. “How can you expect somebody to just go on about their day without thinking about what’s going on … when my country, my people, are currently being killed and our existence is under threat.”

“HOW CAN YOU EXPECT SOMEBODY TO JUST GO ON ABOUT THEIR DAY WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT WHAT’S GOING ON… WHEN MY COUNTRY, MY PEOPLE, ARE CURRENTLY BEING KILLED AND OUR EXISTENCE IS UNDER THREAT.”

Working as the publicist for the Armenian Student Association at UCSB, Assadourian runs the official club Instagram where she posts routinely in efforts to raise awareness and funds for the crisis. She is also heavily involved in club activities where she has noticed general despair among the Armenian students here.

“Everyone feels the same way. All of us can’t focus on our lessons. All of us can’t focus on our everyday lives. This is something that’s weighing down on us constantly, every minute of every day,” Assadourian elaborated.

“You’ll be cooking your food and in the back of your mind, you’re thinking ‘There are soldiers on the front line who don’t have food right now. People are in bomb shelters right now, scrambling for food.’ It’s not an easy thing to deal with.”

Assadourian also fears for her family and friends currently living in Armenia, stating, “It’s really scary thinking about these people that I know, that I love, and I care about … To think that their lives are being threatened every day, every moment is just super scary.”

During her last quarter at UCSB, Stepanian, a philosophy major with a minor in applied psychology, finds herself and her Armenian peers in a perpetual cycle of anxiety brought on by the Azerbaijan offensive.

“We’re just online 24/7, update: Google to Instagram, Instagram to Facebook, Facebook to Twitter … all in the same circular pattern. We’re not getting any sleep. None of us have slept in like two weeks. We’re just going in the circle trying to see what’s going on next,” stated Stepanian. Such a stressful routine has interfered with her studies.

“I want to do good in school, but I also want to be able to point at a map and show people where I’m from one day,” Stepanian explained.

Adding to her distress, Stepanian feels hurt “that people want to remain neutral or unbiased and not educate themselves on the actual history affecting what’s happening.”

The crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh is drastically becoming worse as a ceasefire, announced last Saturday, has been broken by supposedly both parties.

The Bottom Line will continue following the crisis, and will soon release an update regarding the response of UCSB and what students here are doing to support Armenia.",1560
COVID-19 Puts Pressure on 2020 Census,"With the Supreme Court decision to halt the 2020 census population count — put forth by the Trump administration on Oct. 13 — the UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) Complete Count Committee was left with a 48-hour notice to count every individual who had not yet filled out the census.

Viviana Marsano, Isla Vista Liaison and Senior Advisor to Campus Organization from the Office of Student Affairs shared some harsh realities of the difficulties students in Isla Vista (I.V.) faced with filling out the census. 

Fourteen months ago — when Marsano was designated as UCSB’s main contact for the census — she could not have predicted that the official day of the census opening, March 12, would be the day before students were sent home, due to the COVID-19 pandemic shutting down university campuses across the country. 

“All of a sudden we had to change our strategy and communicate to 24,000 parents whose undergraduates were coming home from college,” Marsano said. “Santa Barbara County was one of the lowest counted in 2010, so the pandemic only made accounting for each person more difficult.”

“THE 2020 CENSUS DECIDES HOW 700 BILLION DOLLARS IS ALLOCATED ACROSS THE COUNTRY — INCLUDING FEDERAL LOANS, FREE LUNCH FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS, SCHOOLS AND LABS, AND MANY OTHER WAYS TO IMPROVE THE SANTA BARBARA COMMUNITY AND UCSB.”

After asking Marsano what she thought made it challenging for students in I.V. to fill out the census this year, she replied that the confusion about which home address they should use was a major culprit, considering that many students had ended their leases in I.V. and moved back home.

Marsano’s Complete Count Committee worked for hours phone banking, starting a social media campaign, buying air time on TV and radio shows, and sending reminders via email to a list of 36,000 undergraduates to make sure every student and resident of I.V. would be counted. In an interview with The Bottom Line, Marsano brought up the importance of the census, emphasizing that “every person not counted was $2,000 less per person per year, which meant $20,000 less per person for the next 10 years.” 

According to Marsano, these numbers highlight the necessity of the census as a means to distribute resources and funding to counties across the United States — a mission that halting the census did not help.

Within the United States, there are four undercounted populations, one of which being college students. The 2020 census decides how $700 billion is allocated across the country — including federal loans, free lunch for low-income students, schools and labs, and many other ways to improve the Santa Barbara community and UCSB. 

Ultimately, Marsano estimates that 71.8 percent of Santa Barbara County residents filled out the census by self reporting, while I.V. is estimated to have 60 percent of its residents having filled out the census and the United States having about 66.9 percent of its total population. She believes these results are still much better than they were 10 years ago, but when adding in the strain of the pandemic to the Supreme Court ruling to halt the census — the struggles of the U.S. census persist.",1050
College Admission Standards Change Amidst COVID-19,"College admissions — like all things throughout the current pandemic — have had to change in response to the ways in which we’ve been displaced. As admissions season draws near for both incoming freshman and transfer students, significant changes have been made to admission criteria in response to the COVID-19 crisis. 

Lisa Przekop, the director of the Office of Admissions at UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), confirmed that last year’s admissions team took off a significantly higher number of students from their waitlist. In 2019, about 10 percent of students on the waitlist were admitted to the university. This year, that number climbed — along with the proportion of admitted students — by 7 percent. Additionally, Przekop told The Bottom Line (TBL) that test scores will no longer be a requirement for both incoming freshman and transfer students this upcoming admissions cycle. 

According to Przekop, the UC Board of Regents approved 14 criteria for admission in 2020. In May of this year, they held a vote which determined to make test scores optional as a supplemental testament of the student’s ability. The general UC admissions system, which selects students in a holistic evaluation process, does not believe that removing test scores from the admissions requirement will be too extreme a shift from the original system.

“Fundamentally, our review will not change dramatically,” commented Przekop in the interview with TBL. “We look at each applicant individually and their accomplishments in the context of what they have available to them.”

The elimination of testing requirements may suggest that other aspects of the application will change with the current circumstances.

Opportunities in extracurriculars, internships, and employment, which are fields usually used to distinguish applicants, have diminished this year in both accessibility and level of interest. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as of September 2020, the jobless rate and the number of unemployed people were 4.4 percentage points and 6.8 million, respectively. These numbers, though lower than the rate of unemployment at the start of the crisis, still remain lower than they were pre-pandemic. 

Students have reported that it is difficult to keep up extracurricular engagement and job search efforts when the only modes of communication are behind the screen. Additionally, some schools have opted to use the pass/no-pass system for grading recently, complicating the direct review of the applicant’s academic performance.

Furthermore, students have been struggling to deal with other aspects of the pandemic, which can hinder their productivity and eligibility for admission. While some students are self-quarantining at home and are able to find remote work, others have struggled to even find secure housing for the 2020-21 school year. Earlier this year, students who were initially hired as resident assistants formed a coalition to help themselves and their peers find somewhere to live after the dorms closed.

Mental health concerns have also made it harder for certain students to be more productive. Some students have had to return to potentially abusive households after coming home from college, and others have been hurt by the lack of routine and social interactions while in quarantine. 

“For many survivors of abuse in childhood, going to college served as an escape from an emotionally, physically, and/or sexually abusive home life,” reported Anna Marston, an intern for Mental Health America. “Given the financial strain, job loss, death and grief, and increased social isolation during the virus, experts also worry that the heightened stress might increase violence.”

Because people have been affected by the pandemic in different ways, admissions officers have decided to take a more nuanced approach towards applicant review.

“Students will be missing different pieces of applications, so the review won’t be the same for everyone,” said NPR Broadcaster Tovia Smith on the Morning Edition Podcast. “[Admissions officers will] be working overtime trying to triangulate each piece of the application they have, to make up for what they don’t.”

Some schools have looked towards application elements to gain a better read on the applicant as a person, rather than a collection of numbers. Smith reported that schools like Tulane and Bowdoin have added new sections to the application process, including an optional interview and a series of impromptu discussion questions, respectively.

Given the changes to UCSB’s admission systems, many have wondered if the changes to the admissions process reflect a bigger revolution at hand. Schools like New York University and the University of Chicago implemented test-flexible policies into their admissions system long before COVID-19 became relevant. They — among other universities — are gravitating towards an even more nuanced evaluation of each applicant, and some think that a more holistic stance on college admissions may become the new normal.",1480
Coping With Social Isolation: Drug Use Rising Among Students,"Drug use has grown exponentially during this pandemic. As we dive deeper into what seems to be a never-ending age of uncertainty, students have resorted to excessive drug usage.

During a time all students are only able to hold close to the moments that were once a part of chaotic college life, drug use as a coping mechanism is on the rise. As student life changes to fit a new normal, drug-use habits have been changing as well. This new problem is best examined from the student scope. 

Students currently living in both Isla Vista and their home-towns sat down for interviews with The Bottom Line to discuss potential reasons why drug use has reached a peak among students. 

Shivanghi Patel, a second-year microbiology major with a minor in sociocultural linguistics, said in an interview that “this rise in drug use will have long-term detrimental effects on college students.” Patel explains that “the reliance on drug use may lead to a spike in addiction and at that point, it will be much harder to handle.” Patel believes that “the rise in drug use will lead to a sharp decline in student life” as well.

Students also expressed their concerns over the financial aspect of the spike in drug use. Ria Kotecha, a second-year biology student currently living in Isla Vista, says that the spike in drug use can lead to a “financial crisis that students did not anticipate would occur.” 

Kotecha elaborated that students who are “financially supporting themselves may be put … at a greater risk of financial difficulty” as a result of drug use. 

“Although it may not seem as if a lot of money is being spent on drugs, as time progresses, students may not realize before it is too late,” said Kotecha.

Luca Angeleri, a second-year physics major, explained that the rise in drug use “affects students’ ability to fight Covid-19” if they happen to contract the virus. “Covid-19 affects the lungs greatly, and because of this, students who smoke will be at a definite greater risk if they get the virus.”

Angeleri believes that “the spike in drug use does nothing but put people at greater risk” during a time where people should be taking the best care of themselves. 

Social isolation has been an unfortunate part of this pandemic, but students believe it leads to more problems when social isolation is centered around drug use. 

Dylan Delaney, a second-year art major, emphasized that “some people may believe that drug use is an escape from the harsh-reality of boredom, but in reality, it leads to a greater depth of social isolation” for students. 

In social isolation, students may be safe from the coronavirus, but “potential threats revolving around alcohol poisoning or a drug overdose increases” which puts student safety at risk.

As students try to navigate through the uncharted waters of life, the spike in drug use does nothing but make it more difficult for them. Drug use puts student safety at risk by leading them to live a destructive lifestyle. 

In a time where people’s first priority should be to take all necessary precautions for staying healthy, drug use does the exact opposite. No one knows the definitive answer to when life may go back to normal, however, if the upward trend of drug use continues — long-term effects may impact students.",691
UCSB Party Instagram,"This past week, Isla Vista has witnessed a dramatic uptick in partying incidences. According to student journalist Max Abrams — who photographed the incident — nearly 500 locals searched for parties to attend on Saturday, making it the largest mass-partying scandal since Aug. 30. 

The spectacle was a violation of statewide public health guidelines, which order residents not to host large gatherings. The most recent Health Officer Order issued in Santa Barbara County states that public gatherings — both large and small — are prohibited unless attendees can maintain proper physical distancing. 

Many students have expressed the want to return to normalcy. The recent rise in partying can be attributed to large numbers of UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) students moving into Isla Vista for the 2020-21 school year after months of quarantining in their hometowns.

Public health officials have advised residents to not invite other people into their own homes. While what residents choose to do within their own homes have not been directly affected by the recent health orders, the Santa Barbara public health order issued on Aug. 30 prohibits any gatherings drawing people from different residences together. Experts say the difficulty of contact tracing for parties along with the lack of physical distancing makes the spread of COVID-19 much more likely.

On Sept. 29, the San Luis Obispo Tribune reported that out of all COVID-19 cases in Isla Vista, UCSB students represent more than 60 percent of all cases. As of Oct. 9, there have been 241 total cases of COVID-19 and 1 death caused by COVID-19 in Isla Vista. Eight cases are currently active.

A new page on Instagram called @ucsb.party has taken to the platform to communicate their distaste with the current partying uptick. The owner initially created the page as a small part of a research project, but then chose to change their direction with the account upon the Aug. 30 incident. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/CF7dO63F6gZ/
“The account itself started out as a tiny part of the project, but the more I learned about how the issue not only caused cases to spike, but also caused dorms to be shut down and people to lose their housing, the more I became invested in the issue,” said the owner of @ucsb.party to The Bottom Line. “Ultimately, I would like for [the page] to become a hub for people to learn about partying during a pandemic, how to report parties, and how to hold people accountable.”

Students that have chosen to party usually argue that the decisions they make are their own, justifying the risks they take when partying during the pandemic. The owner of @ucsb.party connects this attitude not only with the fact that we live in an individualistic society, but also with the fact that isolation desensitizes people to the needs of those around them.",1623
UC President Michael Drake Announces New Influenza Vaccine Requirement for All UC Campuses,"On July 31, the University of California President, Michael Drake, issued an executive order which requires all students, faculty, and staff on or near the University of California campuses to get an influenza vaccine by Nov. 1.

In response to this new mandate, UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) Student Health (SHS) is holding appointments for flu shots to make the vaccine available for students on campus and in Isla Vista. 

Jackie Ruiz, a public information officer at the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department, emphasized the importance of receiving a vaccination by the end of October in an interview with the Bottom Line. 

“From the Public Health Department perspective, we recommend getting a flu shot by the end of October as it takes about two weeks for antibodies to develop and protect you,” she said. The department also highly suggests a yearly flu vaccination for people six months or older. 

The UC SHIP health insurance plan covers the cost of the flu vaccine, while students with SHS Gaucho Access Plan pay $15, and students who have waived both options pay $30. Aside from the offerings on campus, the vaccine is still accessible in Santa Barbara County. Many local pharmacies offer flu vaccines, according to Ruiz. 

“Most insurance companies, including Medi-Cal, cover the cost of a flu shot,” she said. 

Students who receive a vaccine outside of Student Health must use the Point N Click electronic health record system through the SHS portal to indicate that they received the influenza vaccination. This also includes students residing outside of the UCSB area. 

Executive Director of Student Health Vejas Skripkus explained what happens if a student is not vaccinated before the deadline of Nov. 1: “They will remain non-compliant in the electronic health record until they either receive the vaccine and attest to having received it, or submit the flu exemption and attest to the exemption.”

Students in need of a medical exemption or accommodation can log on to the Student Health Portal to submit their requests for approval. It is unclear what the consequences are from UCSB for students who do not comply with the mandate by the start of November, but it is possible that a class registration block could be enacted. 

As parties and large gatherings continue in Isla Vista with maskless attendees and little enforcement of social distancing, the flu might continue to spread throughout the community as active case numbers for COVID-19 are on an incline.

A weekly update shared by the UCSB’s external vice president for local affairs on Oct. 7 reported an increase of 10 new COVID-19 cases in Isla Vista. A more recent Oct. 12 update from UCSB radio station KCSB-FM 91.9 shows an increase of four COVID-19 cases since Friday, Oct. 9.  

By requiring immunization for the 2020-21 flu season, UCSB is doing its part to protect its students, faculty, and the health of the surrounding community. If this critical step is taken, hospitals in Santa Barbara County will be able to preserve their resources and equipment for COVID-19 cases, Skripkas explained. 

“The flu can strike anyone, and even young, healthy individuals can be out of commission for two weeks or more due to fever and fatigue,” said Skripkus. 

“Because people of all ages can die from influenza, it’s critically important that we protect as much as possible the more vulnerable among us — our children, our parents, and our grandparents.” 

Additional information on the 2020-21 flu season and vaccine can be found on the Centers for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) website. ",1535
UCSB’s COVID-19 Plans,"On Aug. 20, worker and student union UAW 2865 held a joint labor-management meeting with Jessica Graham and Tara Wise of the UC Santa Barbara Employee & Labor Relations Board, and Cindy Doherty, director of UCSB’s Academic Personnel, to seek answers for UCSB’s protocol for reopening campus, controlling COVID-19’s spread, and keeping on-campus workers and students safe during the pandemic. 

The Employee & Labor Relations Board says there have been no plans made for how to safely reopen the campus, how the school will mobilize against COVID-19, and how academic student employees (ASE) will be protected at work and at home.

Though Chancellor Henry T. Yang recently sent out an email update stating that almost all fall quarter classes — aside from a select number of labs and performance classes — will be held online, the university has kept its constituents in the dark regarding exact details of reopening. 

With the fluctuations in the COVID-19 curve over the past few months, plans that higher-education institutions have developed remain subject to change. Since the tail end of June, numbers of new cases have oscillated between steep spikes and drops. 

According to KCSB-FM news, cases in Santa Barbara County have generally diminished; but, cases in Isla Vista and Goleta are still on the rise, especially among citizens between the ages of 18 and 29. Last week, the Public Health Department of Santa Barbara County confirmed the first COVID-19-related death in Isla Vista; the individual was between 50 and 69 years old and involved with a “congregate care facility.”

Though UCSB Housing, Dining, & Auxiliary Enterprises has made plans for provisional student lodging for COVID-19 patients, the virus will remain a primary concern once the campus eventually reopens. These plans to address this concern already include paid leave for sick ASEs but ideally should also include remote availability of in-person course material and sufficient healthcare services for students living on campus with symptoms. 

The university decisions responding to the COVID-19 crisis have mainly been in the hands of university management, which broadly includes the chairs of different academic and staff departments. While the Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) commission at UCSB has published information on the nature of the virus and the appropriate protocol to follow on their website, they are not directly involved in the executive decisions relevant to the changing state of public health.

“There’s a lot of information on (the EH&S) website, but they are not responsible for enforcement,” said Tara Wise in the joint labor-management meeting. “There is no specific enforcement that has been designed.”

The most critical questions with campus reopening revolve around classroom sizes, enforcing the active resistance against COVID-19, and what sources the university is using to inform them about their decisions.

In Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s most recent COVID-19 update, he stated that almost all courses will likely be held remotely; he confirmed that currently, UCSB is not authorized to hold any indoor lectures. Despite the terms of this update, the current incline in cases has made any plans to really “reopen” the campus unlikely for the Fall quarter.

With the reopening of campus also comes the need to enforce the rules surrounding public safety. The UCSB Police Department has not been enforcing social distancing protocol, and there are no plans to involve them in it later on. 

UCSB is crafting another self-reporting system to hold ASEs accountable for any behavior that violates public health guidelines, yet this self-reporting system may raise another set of concerns. Many student feedback systems, especially those pertaining to teaching assistant evaluations, have historically demonstrated a bias against women and people of color. 

A self-reporting system that seeks external confirmation may minimize the chances of racially and sexually charged targeting, but any self-reporting system could be problematic in the future. 

The issue of worker’s protections, specifically ASEs who work in the research labs or work as teaching assistants, is largely relevant in figuring out how the campus will reopen. According to Jessica Graham in the joint labor-management meeting, an ASE is seen as a worker only when they are in the workplace; otherwise, they are considered students. This could mean that if an ASE were to be in an indoor gathering of more than ten people outside of their job, they may not be suspended from their work, since they violated safety guidelines as students rather than as teachers. 

“We want to make sure that the ASEs are comfortable with working on campus if there’s still the need,” said Dylan Kupsh, the campus unit chair of UAW 2865, in an interview with The Bottom Line. “Every voice needs to be represented.”

Moreover, a way to make sure that student workers are secure in their place of work during the pandemic has yet to be addressed. At the joint labor-management meeting, it was confirmed that the university would accept a situation in which an ASE would need to work on campus despite possible health concerns. Undoubtedly, immunocompromised workers need a voice in the decisions made during these tumultuous times. 

Chancellor Yang has already shared plans to go remote for the Fall quarter. However, every university should be transparent with its students and faculty with what goes into their decisions and how their plans will be implemented. When UCSB ultimately reopens its doors, its community needs to know they have options, resources, and backups for any changes that may arise.",3773
